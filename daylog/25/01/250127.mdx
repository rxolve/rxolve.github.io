## The Distributed Consensus Problem and the Necessity of Paxos

In a distributed environment, multiple nodes must maintain the same state or command sequence.
For example, consensus is essential in database log replication or leader election processes.
However, ensuring agreement amidst various failure scenarios such as network delays, message loss, and node failures is a highly challenging problem.
Paxos provides a method to achieve safe consensus while balancing safety—ensuring that two nodes do not make different decisions—and liveness.
According to the FLP theorem, guaranteeing a decision in a fully asynchronous system is difficult, but Paxos prioritizes safety in most cases.

## Key Roles in Paxos

Paxos defines three fundamental roles:

- Proposer: Receives client requests and initiates a proposal. While multiple proposers may exist simultaneously, consensus must ultimately converge on a single value.
- Acceptor: Accepts proposed values, and a proposal is finalized only if a majority of acceptors agree on the same value.
- Learner: Learns the chosen value and applies it to execute actual tasks (e.g., updating a state machine).

In practical systems, a single node may take on multiple roles simultaneously.

## The Two-Phase Protocol of Paxos

Paxos consists of two main phases.

### Phase 1 – Prepare and Promise

- Prepare Request: The proposer selects a unique, increasing proposal number (N) and sends a _prepare(N)_ message to a majority of acceptors.
- Promise Response: If the received proposal number is greater than any previously accepted number, the acceptor promises not to accept proposals with numbers smaller than N. If it has already accepted a proposal, it responds with the highest accepted proposal number and value.

This phase allows acceptors to share information about previous proposals, laying the foundation for consistency in later phases.

### Phase 2 – Accept and Decide

- Accept Request: Upon receiving responses from a majority of acceptors in Phase 1, the proposer selects the highest-numbered previously accepted value (if any) or chooses its own value and sends an _accept(N, v)_ message.
- Accepted Response: If the proposal number is not smaller than any previously promised number, the acceptor accepts the proposal and responds accordingly.

Once a majority of acceptors accept a proposal, that value is considered chosen and propagated to learners.

## Considerations for Practical Implementation

- Multiple Proposer Conflict: If multiple proposers initiate proposals simultaneously, conflicts may arise, leading to a "proposal number war." This issue can be mitigated through leader election or exponential backoff mechanisms.
- Importance of Quorum: Paxos relies on the intersection of two quorum sets to ensure consistency without losing previous state information.
- Leader Optimization (Multi-Paxos): If a stable leader exists, the prepare phase (Phase 1) can be skipped for subsequent proposals, reducing message delays and improving performance.
- Safety vs. Liveness: While Paxos always guarantees safety, extreme network delays or conflicts may lead to liveness issues, slowing down progress.

## Conclusion

Paxos is a fundamental yet powerful algorithm for achieving consensus in distributed environments.
Its mechanism ensures that all functioning nodes reach the same decision despite network uncertainties and node failures.
Paxos plays a crucial role in real-world applications such as database replication, distributed lock services, and leader election.
Although the algorithm may seem complex, understanding its core principles greatly aids in designing and troubleshooting distributed systems.
