We can solve the problem of finding a rectangle with the maximum sum in a 2D array by expanding the Kadane's algorithm to 2D.

However, this method has a time complexity of O(n^3).

Here, we'll learn how to solve this problem more efficiently using dynamic programming.

## Problem

Given a 2D integer array, find the sum of the rectangular area that has the maximum sum.

## Solution using DP

To solve this problem, we'll use the following approach:

1. Calculate the cumulative sum for each column.
2. For all possible pairs of rows, change the problem into a 1D maximum subarray sum (difference of cumulative sums) problem.
3. Solve the changed 1D problem in O(n) time.

## Code Implementation

```typescript
const maxRectangleSum = (matrix: number[][]): number => {
  if (!matrix || matrix.length === 0 || matrix[0].length === 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  const rows = matrix.length;
  const cols = matrix[0].length;
  let maxSum = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;

  // Create cumulative sum array
  const prefixSum = Array.from({ length: rows + 1 }, () =>
    Array.from({ length: cols }, () => 0)
  );

  // Calculate cumulative sum
  // prefixSum[i][j] = matrix[0][j] + matrix[1][j] + ... + matrix[i - 1][j]
  for (let i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
      prefixSum[i][j] = prefixSum[i - 1][j] + matrix[i - 1][j];
    }
  }

  // Repeat for all row pairs from top to bottom
  for (let top = 0; top < rows; top++) {
    for (let bottom = top; bottom < rows; bottom++) {
      let currentSum = 0;
      let maxEndingHere = 0;

      // Move from left to right to find 1D maximum subarray sum
      for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        // Calculate cumulative sum between current rows
        currentSum = prefixSum[bottom + 1][j] - prefixSum[top][j];
        // Calculate 1D maximum subarray sum
        maxEndingHere = Math.max(currentSum, maxEndingHere + currentSum);
        // Update maximum sum
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, maxEndingHere);
      }
    }
  }

  return maxSum;
};

// Input: 2D Array
const matrix = [
  [1, 2, -1, -4, -20],
  [-8, -3, 4, 2, 1],
  [3, 8, 10, 1, 3],
  [-4, -1, 1, 7, -6],
];

console.log(maxRectangleSum(matrix)); // Output: 29
```

## Algorithm Explanation

1. Cumulative Sum Calculation: First, we calculate the cumulative sum for each column. This allows us to calculate the sum of any rectangular area in O(1) time.

2. Row Pair Selection: We repeat for all possible pairs of top and bottom rows.

3. Change to 1D Problem: We change the area between the selected rows into a 1D array. Each element is the difference of cumulative sums for that column.

4. Find 1D Maximum Subarray Sum: We find the maximum subarray sum in the changed 1D array. This is solved in O(n) time, similar to Kadane's algorithm.

5. Update Maximum Sum: If the found maximum subarray sum is larger than the overall maximum sum, we update it.

## Time Complexity Analysis

- Cumulative Sum Calculation: O(rows \* cols)
- Row Pair Selection: O(rows^2)
- Finding 1D Maximum Subarray Sum for Each Row Pair: O(cols)

Therefore, the total time complexity is O(rows^2 \* cols). This is much more efficient than the previous O(rows^3 \* cols) approach.

## Space Complexity

This algorithm uses additional O(rows \* cols) space to store the cumulative sums.

## Conclusion

This approach using dynamic programming improves the time complexity of the 2D Kadane's algorithm from O(rows^3 \* cols) to O(rows^2 \* cols).

This shows better performance especially for large matrices with many columns.

It can be useful in tasks dealing with large-scale 2D data such as image processing and data analysis.
