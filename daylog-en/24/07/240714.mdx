- Gather scattered code into one pile until you feel you have enough. Then clean it up neatly.
- Reading and understanding code costs more than writing it.
  - If you tidy up first, you can remove connections in smaller pieces and make the code fit together better.
  - This reduces how much code detail you need to remember at once.
- To make things clear again, gather the code together and take out the hard-to-understand parts to organize them newly.
- Look for these signs:
  - Long, repeating lists of arguments
  - Repeating code, especially repeating if-statements
  - Helper functions with bad names
  - Shared data structures that change a lot
- It might seem odd to talk about aiming for smaller pieces while also making one big pile.
  - I sometimes doubt myself when I try hard to understand code in small pieces.
  - At these times, I do a complete turn-around and start putting everything together.
  - The relief I feel then is hard to describe!
- As the pile grows, a picture starts to form in my mind.
  - Now I get it. Why didn't anyone tell me this before?
  - At this point, we come to the question in the book title.
  - Should we tidy the code first? Or should we just change what we see now?

> I was glad to hear that Kent Beck also has similar difficulties when reading code. I plan to follow his good advice.
