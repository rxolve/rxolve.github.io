- A problem came up while reviewing a Pull Request (PR).
- I accidentally pushed to someone else's branch.
- The command we need in this situation is `git reset`.

### git reset Modes

#### --soft

- This mode goes back to the chosen commit in the commit history, but keeps the changes in the staging area.
- HEAD points to the current checked-out commit, and HEAD~1 means the commit just before it.
  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD~1
  ```
- You can also choose the commit you want to go back to using its hash value.
  ```bash
  git reset --soft 1a2b3c4d
  ```

#### --mixed

- This mode goes back in the commit history and clears the staging area, but doesn't change the files in your working directory.

#### --hard

- This mode goes back in the commit history, clears the staging area, and changes the files in your working directory to match the chosen commit.

---

- I used `git reset --hard HEAD~2` to go back two commits.
- git reset is a powerful command that changes history.
  - You need to be careful when using it, especially the --hard mode, because it can cause you to lose data.
  - I was shaking while typing the command.
