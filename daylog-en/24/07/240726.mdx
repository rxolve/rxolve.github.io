Let's take a look at shadcn, a UI component library that's been getting a lot of attention in the web development community lately.

I was curious about how shadcn is taking a different approach from existing UI libraries to attract developers' interest.

## What is shadcn?

shadcn is a collection of React-based UI components. However, instead of being a typical npm package library, it adopts a "copy-paste" approach to providing components.

## How do you pronounce it?

shadcn/ui is the #1 trending word on DevMalssami as of today. It's pronounced "shad-see-en-you-eye".

## Key Features

### Copy-Paste Model

The biggest feature of shadcn is that you directly copy the component code into your project to use it. This allows for a high degree of customization freedom and complete control over your project.

### Tailwind CSS-based Styling

shadcn uses Tailwind CSS as its basic styling tool. This enables quick styling and prototyping, and you can build a consistent design system using Tailwind's utility classes.

### Accessibility-Centered Design

All components are designed to comply with high standards of web accessibility.

### Headless Approach

It adopts a headless UI pattern, allowing developers to style as they wish.

- Headless UI Pattern: An approach that separates functionality and styling to increase the reusability and flexibility of components.

### Component-Centered

It's designed around components rather than roles. This allows for more flexible component design by raising the level of abstraction. By providing reusable basic components, you can easily implement complex UIs by combining them like Lego blocks.

### Learning Resources

Being able to directly see the internal implementation of well-structured components helps with learning. By modifying components, you can learn about the latest web development technologies and patterns.

## Comparing shadcn/ui and Pico CSS

This blog uses Pico CSS. Let's compare the differences between Pico and shadcn.

### Basic Philosophy

- **Pico**: A 'classless' CSS framework that provides a clean design with minimal setup.
- **shadcn**: A customizable component library that gives developers more control.

### Usage Method

- **Pico**: Can be used immediately by linking or installing the CSS file.
- **shadcn**: Copy the needed components into your project for use.

### Customization

- **Pico**: Basic customization is possible through CSS variables.
- **shadcn**: High-degree customization is possible by directly accessing component code.

### Target

- **Pico**: Suitable for quick prototyping or simple projects.
- **shadcn**: Suitable for large-scale projects that need complex UIs and high-level customization.

### Learning Curve

- **Pico**: Very low learning curve, can be applied quickly.
- **shadcn**: Requires understanding of React and Tailwind CSS, with a relatively higher learning curve.

## Using shadcn/ui and Pico CSS Together

I tried to strategize using Pico for basic components and shadcn for UI components I want to customize. However, I couldn't resolve conflicting styles.

```CSS
// globals.css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@picocss/pico@2/css/pico.min.css");

@tailwind utilities;

// To use shadcn/ui, you need to import the following directives here:
// @tailwind base;
// @tailwind components;
// Doing this breaks Pico.
```

In the end, it seems like I can only partially utilize shadcn.

## Conclusion

shadcn well reflects the trends of modern web development while presenting new possibilities to developers with its unique approach. Compared to simple frameworks like Pico, shadcn shows strengths in higher-level customization and complex UI implementation.

I could see that shadcn has become an attractive tool, especially for developers who want complete control over their project.

Although I'm still using a combination of Pico and Tailwind, I'm considering partially introducing shadcn as the complexity of the project increases.
