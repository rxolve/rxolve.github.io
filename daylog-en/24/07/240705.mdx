- Sometimes you find that some data a routine uses isn't passed to it clearly. How can we make the input clearer in these cases?
  - Split the routine. Fill in the parameter values in the first part, then pass them clearly to the second part.
- It's common for parameters to be passed as a block.
  - (In JavaScript, this is like passing an object as a parameter.)
  - This makes it hard to know what data is needed when you're reading the code.
  - It can lead to bad practices, like changing the parameters without telling anyone.
- Before:

  ```typescript
    params = {a:1, b:2}
    foo(params)

    function foo(params)
      ...params.a... ...params.b...

  ```

  - After:

  ```typescript
  function foo(params)
    foo_body(params.a, params.b)

  function foo_body(a, b)
    ...a... ...b...

  ```

- Make the parameters show up clearly, then get ready to call functions one after another.
- This makes the code easier to read, test, and understand.
