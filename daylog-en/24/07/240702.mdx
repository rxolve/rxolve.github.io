- The [pg_stat_statements](https://postgresql.kr/docs/9.5/pgstatstatements.html) module lets you collect and view statistics about queries.

  - It's one of PostgreSQL's extra features. It collects and gives you performance statistics for all SQL queries run in the database.
  - You can see how often queries are run, how long they take in total, and on average.

- To use the pg_stat_statements module:

1. Change the postgresql.conf file to turn on the related settings.

   - This file is usually in the PostgreSQL installation folder or data folder.
   - Add or change these lines:

     ```conf
     shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
     pg_stat_statements.track = all
     ```

   - If you're using AWS RDS, you need to change this in the cluster parameter group.

2. Install the pg_stat_statements module.
   - Connect to your database and run this command:
     ```sql
     CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
     ```
3. Restart the PostgreSQL server.
   - For AWS RDS:
     - If you change shared_preload_libraries or pg_stat_statements.max, you need to restart.
     - Other changes work without restarting.
4. Check the statistics with a query.

   - Run this query to see the query, how often it's run, how many rows it returns, and how long it takes (in microseconds):
     ```sql
       SELECT
           query,
           calls,
           rows,
           total_exec_time
       FROM
           pg_stat_statements
       ORDER BY
           total_exec_time DESC
       LIMIT 100;
     ```

5. Analyze and improve query performance.
