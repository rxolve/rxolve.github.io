### What's the buzz about ISR?

I looked into ISR and learned about how Next.js 14 shows web pages. Let's break it down!

Next.js 14 can show web pages in three main ways: static, dynamic, and streaming. This makes it super flexible. Let's look at each one:

### 1. Static Rendering

Static rendering makes pages when you build your website. It's like pre-making food before a party.

#### Good things:

- Pages load really fast
- Doesn't make your server work too hard
- Great for search engines to find your site

#### Not-so-good things:

- Hard to show stuff that changes a lot
- Need to rebuild pages when you update information

#### Here's an example:

```jsx
import { getAllPosts, getPostBySlug } from "@/lib/api";

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getAllPosts();
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }));
}

export default async function Post({ params }) {
  const post = await getPostBySlug(params.slug);
  return <article>{/* Show post content here */}</article>;
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Rendering

Dynamic rendering makes pages every time someone asks for them. It's like cooking food right when someone orders it.

#### Good things:

- Always shows the newest information
- Can handle stuff that changes a lot
- Great for search engines too

#### Not-so-good things:

- Pages might load a bit slower at first
- Makes your server work harder

#### Here's an example:

```jsx
import { getCurrentUser } from "@/lib/auth";
import { getDashboardData } from "@/lib/api";

export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";

export default async function Dashboard() {
  const user = await getCurrentUser();
  const dashboardData = await getDashboardData(user.id);
  return <div>{/* Show dashboard content here */}</div>;
}
```

### 3. Streaming

Streaming shows part of the page first, then loads the rest bit by bit. It's like getting your appetizer while the main course is still cooking.

#### Good things:

- Pages start showing up faster
- Makes the website feel smoother
- Helps big, complicated pages load better

#### Here's an example:

```jsx
import { Suspense } from "react";
import ProductDetails from "./ProductDetails";
import RelatedProducts from "./RelatedProducts";

export default function Product({ params }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Product {params.id}</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading product details...</div>}>
        <ProductDetails id={params.id} />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading related products...</div>}>
        <RelatedProducts id={params.id} />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

ISR updates static pages every so often or when you ask it to. It's like having pre-made food but checking and replacing it regularly to keep it fresh.

#### Good things:

- Pages load fast like static rendering
- Can update content regularly or when you need to
- Combines the good parts of static and dynamic rendering

#### Here's an example:

```jsx
// app/posts/[slug]/page.js
import { getAllPosts, getPostBySlug } from "@/lib/api";

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getAllPosts();
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }));
}

export default async function Post({ params }) {
  const post = await getPostBySlug(params.slug);
  return <article>{/* Show post content here */}</article>;
}

export const revalidate = 3600; // Check for updates every hour
```

### Should I use ISR?

I learned that I could easily use ISR on this post page by adding the revalidate option.

But I also realized that this page doesn't change, so it doesn't need ISR.

I decided that if I make parts of the site that change a lot in the future, I'll try using ISR then.
