- You know that moment when you're reading code and you think, "Oh, that's how it works!"?
  - That's a precious moment. Write it down!
- Only write about things that aren't clear in the code.
  - Imagine you're reading this code for the first time.
  - What do you wish you knew before?
- The key is to think from someone else's point of view and try to answer questions they might have before they ask.
- If there's no comment at the start of a file, add one to tell people what they'll learn from reading it.
- If you find a problem in the code, write a comment about it right away.
  - For example: "// If you want to add a new case, you must change ../foo"
  - It's better to point out problems with comments than to leave them hidden like they're buried in sand.
