- Sometimes we find a piece of code that has a clear purpose and doesn't interact much with the rest of the code.
  - We take out this code, make it a helper, and give it a name.
  - We name the helper based on what it does, not how it works.
  - This cleaning method is called 'method extraction' in refactoring.
- I want to mention a few special cases when extracting helpers:
  - When you need to change a few lines in a big routine:
    - Take those lines out and make them a helper
    - Change only what's inside the helper
    - If it looks good, use the helper in the main routine
    - Usually, once you start using helpers, you'll want to use them everywhere!
  - Before:
    ```
    routine()
      ...code to keep...
      ...code to change...
      ...code to keep...
    ```
  - After:
    ```
    helper()
      ...code to change...
    routine()
      ...code to keep...
      ...helper()...
      ...code to keep...
    ```
  - This makes parts of your code that work well together.
  - Another special case is when one thing needs to happen before another:
    - If a() must be called before b()
    - Before:
      ```
      foo.a()
      foo.b()
      ```
    - After:
      ```
      ab()
        a()
        b()
      ```
- As you make helpers, you'll find yourself wanting to use them again very quickly.
  - This process makes you think about problems in new ways.
  - When we can give new names to parts of our design, we come up with new ideas.
    - (**Today's key sentence!**)
- You can use helpers wherever you need them.
  - Some coding tools can find places where your new helper could be used and even change the code for you.
  - We're lucky to have these tools!
