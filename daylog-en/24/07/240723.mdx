# Interface vs Type

In TypeScript, both `interface` and `type` are used to define types, but there are some important differences. Let's look at them:

## 1. How to Write Them

### Interface

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

### Type

```typescript
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

## 2. How to Make Them Bigger

### Interface

You can make interfaces bigger using the `extends` keyword:

```typescript
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Cat extends Animal {
  meow(): void;
}
```

### Type

Types can do something similar using the `&` symbol:

```typescript
type Animal = {
  name: string;
};

type Cat = Animal & {
  meow(): void;
};
```

## 3. Combining Declarations

### Interface

You can declare interfaces with the same name multiple times, and they will automatically combine:

```typescript
interface Car {
  brand: string;
}

interface Car {
  model: string;
}

// Result: Car now has both brand and model
```

### Type

You can't declare types with the same name more than once:

```typescript
type Car = {
  brand: string;
};

// Error: You can't use 'Car' again
type Car = {
  model: string;
};
```

## 4. Special Type Tricks

### Type

Types can do some cool tricks like mapped types:

```typescript
type Keys = "firstName" | "lastName";
type DuplicateString<T extends string> = { [K in T]: string };

type NameFields = DuplicateString<Keys>;
// Result: { firstName: string; lastName: string; }
```

### Interface

Interfaces can't do these special tricks directly.

## 5. Union Types

### Type

Types can define union types directly:

```typescript
type Status = "pending" | "approved" | "rejected";
```

### Interface

Interfaces can't define union types directly. You need to use a type for this.

## 6. Tuples and Arrays

### Type

Types can easily define tuples:

```typescript
type Point = [number, number];
```

### Interface

Interfaces can define something similar to tuples, but it's not as simple:

```typescript
interface Point {
  0: number;
  1: number;
  length: 2;
}
```

## Conclusion

- Use `interface` when you're defining the shape of objects, especially if you need to extend them or combine declarations.
- Use `type` for more varied type definitions, like union types, intersections, or aliases for basic types.

Usually, people use `interface` for object structures and `type` for other cases (like union types or aliases for basic types). But in newer versions of TypeScript, these two can do many of the same things. So, you can choose based on what your project or team prefers.
