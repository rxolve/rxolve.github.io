# this is Execution Context

When you first learn JavaScript, one of the most interesting and confusing topics is the relationship between `this` and execution context. Let's talk about it!

As we learn about `this`, we'll see that it's not just a simple word, but a powerful idea that's closely connected to how JavaScript works.

## What is Execution Context?

Execution context is like a special space where JavaScript code runs. Each execution context has three main parts:

1. **Variable Environment**: This is where JavaScript stores information about variables created with `var` and function declarations.

2. **Lexical Environment**: This is similar to the Variable Environment, but it's for variables created with `let` and `const`. It also helps with creating closures, which are special functions that remember the environment they were created in.

3. **This Binding**: This part decides what `this` means in the current code. It changes depending on how a function is called.

We're going to focus on the 'This Binding' part.

## This Binding and Execution Context

The value of `this` is decided when a function is called. This happens at the same time as when the execution context is created.

```javascript
const obj = {
  method() {
    console.log(this);
  },
};

obj.method(); // 'this' points to obj
const func = obj.method;
func(); // 'this' points to the global object (or undefined in strict mode)
```

In this example, `obj.method()` and `func()` refer to the same function, but `this` has different values because they're called in different execution contexts.

## Execution Context Stack and this

JavaScript uses something called an execution context stack (or call stack) to keep track of where it is in the code. Each context has its own `this` binding, which depends on how the function was called.

```javascript
function outer() {
  console.log("outer this:", this); // Points to obj if called as a method
  function inner() {
    console.log("inner this:", this); // Points to the global object if called as a regular function
  }
  inner(); // Called as a regular function
}

const obj = { method: outer };
obj.method(); // Called as a method
```

In this example, `outer` and `inner` have different execution contexts, so their `this` values are different.

## Arrow Functions and Lexical This

Arrow functions, introduced in ES6, don't create their own `this` binding. Instead, they use the `this` from the surrounding code.

```javascript
const obj = {
  method: function () {
    console.log("method this:", this); // Points to obj
    const arrowFunc = () => {
      console.log("arrowFunc this:", this); // Also points to obj
    };
    arrowFunc();
  },
};

obj.method();
```

In this case, `arrowFunc`'s `this` is the same as `method`'s `this`. This means that arrow functions don't create a new `this` binding, but use the one from their surrounding environment.

## Controlling Execution Context

JavaScript lets developers control the `this` binding explicitly:

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
}

const person1 = { name: "Alice" };
const person2 = { name: "Bob" };

greet.call(person1); // Hello, Alice
greet.apply(person2); // Hello, Bob

const boundGreet = greet.bind(person1);
boundGreet(); // Hello, Alice
```

The `call`, `apply`, and `bind` methods let you set the execution context of a function explicitly. This is really useful in functional programming.

## Conclusion

In JavaScript, `this` isn't just a simple reference. It's a dynamic concept closely related to the execution context. Understanding and using it well can help you write more flexible and powerful code.

At the same time, because `this` can change, it can sometimes be tricky to predict. So, always be careful when using it!
