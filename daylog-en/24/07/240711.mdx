#### When we need bind

- When writing code, sometimes we need to pass one function to another function.
- We should use 'bind' to make sure it works the way we expect.

```ts
// Wrong example
Book.createByEntity(entity, this.sourceRepo.getQuestions);
```

- The getQuestions method should work within the sourceRepo object.
- But in the code above, it runs in Book.createByEntity, so when getQuestions is called, 'this' might point to:
  - undefined
  - window (in browsers)
  - global (in Node.js)
- This can cause unexpected errors.

#### About bind

- bind is a method of Function objects.
- It creates a new function that has the same code as the original function.
- But 'this' is set to the first argument of bind.

```ts
const boundFunction = originalFunction.bind(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...]]])
```

- thisArg: The value to use as 'this' when the bound function is called
- arg1, arg2, ...: Arguments to pass to the original function (optional)

#### How to use bind

- We can fix the earlier code using bind like this:

```ts
Book.createByEntity(entity, this.sourceRepo.getQuestions.bind(this.sourceRepo));
```

- By using bind, we make sure the getQuestions method always runs within the sourceRepo object.

#### Alternatives to bind

- We can also use arrow functions instead of bind:

```ts
Book.createByEntity(entity, () => this.sourceRepo.getQuestions());
```

- Arrow functions don't have their own 'this', so they use 'this' from the surrounding code.
- You can use whichever way works best for you.
