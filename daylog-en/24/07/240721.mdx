### Introduction

Using two CSS frameworks in one project can be tricky.

Each framework has its own way of doing things, so they might not work well together.

But I wanted to use both Pico and Tailwind, so I tried to make it work.

### 1. Installing Tailwind CSS

> https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs

First, let's install Tailwind CSS.

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

If you're making a new Next project, you can just say "Yes" when it asks if you want to use Tailwind CSS.

### 2. Installing Pico CSS

Now, let's install Pico CSS.

```bash
npm install @picocss/pico
```

### 3. Checking Tailwind CSS settings

Open the `tailwind.config.js` file and change it like this:

Add the paths of the files where you want to use Tailwind in the 'content' part.

I set it up to use Tailwind in all js, ts, jsx, tsx, and mdx files in the app folder.

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export const content = ["./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}"];
export const theme = {
  extend: {},
};
export const plugins = [];
```

We'll use the default settings for the postcss.config.js file.

```js
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

### 4. Setting up global styles

Open the `app/globals.css` file and change it like this:

```css
@import "@picocss/pico/css/pico.min.css";

@tailwind utilities;

/* You can add more custom styles here */
```

This loads Pico's styles first, then applies Tailwind's styles.

Usually, we use three directives, but here we only use @tailwind utilities.

We don't use @tailwind base because it might not work well with Pico's styles. We don't use @tailwind components because we'll use Pico's components.

### 5. Using Tailwind CSS

Now we can use Tailwind CSS instead of regular CSS.

#### Before:

```css
<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    gap: "10px",
    marginBottom: "20px",
  }}
>
```

#### After:

```css
<div class="flex items-center gap-2.5 mb-5">
```

### Conclusion

Using Pico CSS and Tailwind CSS together in Next.js lets us use the best parts of both.

We can use Pico CSS for basic styles and responsive design, and then use Tailwind CSS to make small changes and make things look exactly how we want.
