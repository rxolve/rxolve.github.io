- Where should we perform code cleanup?
- Here's one unsightly scenario that keeps repeating:
  - I include my code cleanup along with behavioral changes in my code.
  - Reviewers complain that my PR is too long.
  - I separate my cleanup changes into a separate PR, either before or after the behavioral change PR.
  - Reviewers complain about the cleanup-only PR, saying they don't understand its purpose.
  - Back to step 1.
- If we do code cleanup, it has to be handled somewhere. So where should we do it?
- Create separate PRs for code cleanup, and try to include only a few cleanups per PR.
- Even if there's just one cleanup, make it a separate PR.
- Similarly, create separate PRs for behavioral changes.
- Each time you switch between cleanup and behavioral changes, you should open a new PR.

  - B: Behavioral change PR
  - S: Code cleanup PR
- Small PRs are usually welcomed as they reduce review time.
  - Being able to review code quickly can motivate you to create even smaller PRs.
  - The clearer the focus, the more a PR encourages faster review.
- Once you become:
  - familiar with code cleanup,
  - accustomed to working in small units,
  - and comfortable working absolutely safely,
    try to be brave and attempt not to review cleanup PRs separately.
- This will further reduce waiting times, encouraging you to create even smaller PRs.
