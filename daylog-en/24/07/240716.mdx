### What is JSON-LD?

- JSON-LD stands for JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data.
- It's a way to organize information on websites so search engines can understand it better.
- Big search engines like Google and Bing really like this format.

### How JSON-LD Was Born

- To understand JSON-LD, we need to know about the "Semantic Web".
- Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web in 1989, had an idea in 1998.
- He wanted to make web information easy for computers to understand.
- People tried different ways to do this, but they were too complicated.
- In 2010, two smart people (Manu Sporny and Dave Longley) came up with JSON-LD.
- JSON-LD is special because:
  - It's simple to use
  - It works well with existing systems
  - It can handle complex information

### How JSON-LD Looks

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Type",
  "property1": "value1",
  "property2": "value2"
}
```

- @context: This tells where the rules for the information come from.
- @type: This says what kind of thing we're describing.

### Nesting and Referring in JSON-LD

JSON-LD can have information inside other information:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "rxolve",
    "sameAs": "https://github.com/rxolve"
  }
}
```

It can also refer to other pieces of information:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@type": "Person",
      "@id": "#rxolve",
      "name": "Rxolve Kim"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Article",
      "author": { "@id": "#rxolve" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Using JSON-LD in Next.js

- There are different ways to use JSON-LD in Next.js.
- One good way is to use a function called `generateMetadata`.
- This function helps manage all the important information about your webpage in one place.

Here's an example:

```jsx
export const generateMetadata = async ({ params }) => {
  const { tag, date } = params;
  const post = await getPost({ date });
  return metadata(post.title, post.content, [tag, post.title]);
};

const metadata = (title, description, keywords) => {
  return {
    title,
    description,
    keywords: keywords.join(", "),
    openGraph: {
      title,
      description,
      images: [{ url: "https://rxolve.github.io/og-image.png" }],
    },
    other: {
      "application/ld+json": JSON.stringify({
        "@context": "https://schema.org",
        "@type": "BlogPosting",
        headline: title,
        description,
        keywords: keywords.join(", "),
      }),
    },
  };
};
```

### Wrapping Up

- JSON-LD is a great tool to make your Next.js website easier for search engines to understand.
- When you use it right, search engines can show more interesting information about your website in search results.
