- Our ML (Machine Learning) team asked for access to our RDS (database) to design a recommendation algorithm.
- We decided to give them a user account with read-only permissions.

Here's how we did it:

1. First, we create a new user:

```sql
CREATE USER readonly_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
```

2. We give this user permission to connect to a specific database:

```sql
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE your_database TO readonly_user;
```

3. After connecting to the database, we give permission to use the public schema:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;
```

4. We give SELECT permission on all tables:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;
```

    - If you want to choose specific tables, replace `ALL TABLES` with table names:
        ```sql
        -- Give permission only for users and books tables
        GRANT SELECT ON TABLE users, books IN SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;
        ```

5. To automatically give SELECT permission on tables created in the future:

```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonly_user;
```

- Now, readonly_user can read all tables in the public schema of the specified database.
  - They can't change data or the structure of tables.
- We gave this account info to the ML team. We hope they'll create a great recommendation algorithm!
