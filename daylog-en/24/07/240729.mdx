Setting up multi-dimensional arrays in JavaScript can be tricky, especially when solving algorithm problems or working on apps that need to be fast.

In this post, we'll learn about using the `Array.from()` method to set up multi-dimensional arrays.

## What is the Array.from() Method?

The `Array.from()` method was added in ES6. It makes a new Array from something that's like an array or can be gone through (like a list).

What's really cool is that it can take a second part that changes each item as it's added.

```javascript
Array.from(arrayLike[, mapFn[, thisArg]])
```

## Setting Up Multi-dimensional Arrays

Using `Array.from()` to set up multi-dimensional arrays can make your code easier to read. It's really useful when working with big arrays.

#### Setting Up a 2D Array

```javascript
const rows = 3;
const cols = 4;

const matrix = Array.from({ length: rows }, () =>
  Array.from({ length: cols }, () => 0)
);

console.log(matrix);
// Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

The good thing about this way is that each row is its own array. So if you change one row, it doesn't affect the others.

#### Setting Up 3D and Higher Arrays

You can set up even bigger arrays the same way:

```javascript
const depth = 2;
const rows = 3;
const cols = 4;

const cube = Array.from({ length: depth }, () =>
  Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array.from({ length: cols }, () => 0))
);

console.log(cube);
// Output: [[[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]], [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]]
```

## Making It Faster

When working with really big multi-dimensional arrays, making them fast is important. `Array.from()` is already pretty fast, but we can make it even faster.

#### Reusing a Pre-made Array

If the same smaller array keeps showing up, we can make it once and reuse it:

```javascript
const rows = 1000;
const cols = 1000;

// Make the column array first
const colArray = Array.from({ length: cols }, () => 0);

// Reuse the column array we made
const matrix = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => [...colArray]);
```

This way, instead of making a new column array for each row, we use a copy of the one we already made. It can be much faster for big arrays.

## Using TypedArray

TypedArray is a special kind of array made for handling number data really fast. It's great for saving memory and doing math quickly.

It might seem weird in JavaScript, but it's useful for things like WebAssembly or WebGL that need to handle data in a special way.

#### Types of TypedArray

JavaScript has different kinds of TypedArray:

- For numbers from 0 to 255: `Int8Array`, `Uint8Array`, `Uint8ClampedArray`
- For 16-bit whole numbers: `Int16Array`, `Uint16Array`
- For 32-bit whole numbers: `Int32Array`, `Uint32Array`
- For decimal numbers: `Float32Array`, `Float64Array`
- For really big whole numbers: `BigInt64Array`, `BigUint64Array`

Each TypedArray is made to work best with a certain kind of number.

#### Setting Up Multi-dimensional Arrays with TypedArray

When using TypedArray to set up multi-dimensional arrays, we do it a bit differently. Here's how to make a 2D array using `Float64Array`:

```javascript
const rows = 1000;
const cols = 1000;

const matrix = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => new Float64Array(cols));
```

This way makes each row a `Float64Array`. This is good because:

- It uses memory well: Each number takes up exactly 64 bits.
- It's faster: The numbers are all next to each other in memory.
- It's safer: All the items are always numbers (with lots of decimal places).

## Testing How Fast It Is

Let's see how fast each way is when making a 1000x1000 2D array:

#### Making a 2D Array with Loops

```ts
const testArrayInit = () => {
  const start = performance.now();
  const arr: Array<number[]> = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    arr.push([]);
    for (let j = 0; j < col; j++) {
      arr[i].push(0);
    }
  }
  const end = performance.now();

  return end - start;
};
```

- Takes about 20ms

#### Making a 2D Array with Array.from()

```ts
const testArrayFrom = () => {
  const start = performance.now();
  const arr: Array<number[]> = Array.from({ length: row }, () =>
    Array.from({ length: col }, () => 0)
  );
  const end = performance.now();

  return end - start;
};
```

- Takes about 40ms
- Slower than using loops

#### Making a 2D Array by Reusing a Pre-made Array

```ts
const testArrayReuse = () => {
  const start = performance.now();
  const colArray = Array.from({ length: col }, () => 0);
  const arr: Array<number[]> = Array.from({ length: row }, () => [...colArray]);
  const end = performance.now();

  return end - start;
};
```

- Takes about 2ms

#### Making a 2D Array with TypedArray

```ts
const testTypedArray = () => {
  const start = performance.now();
  const arr: Array<Float64Array> = Array.from(
    { length: row },
    () => new Float64Array(col)
  );
  const end = performance.now();

  return end - start;
};
```

- Takes about 1ms

## Wrapping Up

Using the `Array.from()` method is a good way to set up and handle multi-dimensional arrays in JavaScript.

This can make things faster, especially when doing lots of math, working with graphics, or looking at data.

In big projects, it's a good idea to make these ways of setting up arrays into helper functions that you can use over and over.
