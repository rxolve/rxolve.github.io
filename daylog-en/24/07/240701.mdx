> - This article covers the birth of the object-oriented paradigm, its principles and methodologies, and the tearful efforts to mimic object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

### Prototype-based Languages

- To use OOP well in JavaScript, you first need to understand **prototype-based** languages.
- While object-oriented programming was developing based on classes, there were languages that implemented object-oriented programming based on prototypes.

#### Self (Late 1980s)

- It's the origin of prototype-based object-oriented languages.
- It adopted a method of defining objects using prototypes instead of classes, and creating new objects by cloning existing objects.

#### Lua (1993)

- It was developed with the goal of being a lightweight scripting language with clean syntax that's very easy to embed in C/C++ programs.

#### JavaScript (1995)

- It's the most famous prototype-based language.
- It's used in various environments beyond its native web browsers, including server-side, mobile apps, and desktops.

#### Dart (2011)

- It was developed for Flutter and created to complement JavaScript's weaknesses.

#### TypeScript (2012)

- It's a superset of JavaScript that supports types.

### Prototype Chain

- The biggest feature of prototype-based languages is that objects are created from other objects, not from classes.
- These objects are connected through a prototype chain.
- If an object can't find a specific property or method, it looks for it in the upper object following this chain.

```javascript
const person = {
  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};

const alice = Object.create(person);
alice.name = "Alice";

const employee = Object.create(alice);
employee.jobTitle = "Developer";
employee.sayJobTitle = function () {
  console.log(`My job title is ${this.jobTitle}`);
};

employee.sayHello(); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
employee.sayJobTitle(); // "My job title is Developer"
```

- Through this chain, concepts of object-oriented programming including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction were implemented.

### Difficulties of OOP in JavaScript

This can bring confusion to people who used class-based object-oriented languages like Java.

- Although the `class` keyword was introduced in ES6, it's just syntactic sugar wrapping prototype-based inheritance.
  - Because it doesn't change the essence of being prototype-based, it can behave differently than expected in implementations like inheritance or method overriding.
- It's easy to add or change properties or methods to objects. Rules are looser compared to class-based languages.
- JavaScript doesn't directly support multiple inheritance.

  - It needs to be solved with patterns like mixins, which requires additional code writing and increases structural complexity.

  ```javascript
  // Define mixin function
  function mixin(target, ...sources) {
    Object.assign(target.prototype, ...sources);
  }

  ...

  // Apply mixin
  mixin(Animal, canSwim, canFly);
  ```

- Above all, JavaScript strongly supports the functional programming paradigm.

  - This makes developers prefer functional implementations, which can easily deviate from an object-oriented perspective.

I think JavaScript's biggest charm is its flexibility to freely use various paradigms.

As in the second to last paragraph of Teo's post:

- Creating small programs based on data and methods to increase code reusability
- Taking advantage of concise syntax
- Avoiding complex structures
- Combining with the advantages of functional programming

This approach could be considered as using object-oriented programming well in JavaScript.
