### Prototype Languages

- To use OOP well in JavaScript, you first need to understand **prototype** languages.
- While some languages were developing OOP based on classes, others were using prototypes.

#### Self (Late 1980s)

- This was the first prototype-based OOP language.
- It used prototypes instead of classes to define objects and made new objects by copying existing ones.

#### Lua (1993)

- It was made to be a simple language that's easy to use inside C/C++ programs.

#### JavaScript (1995)

- This is the most famous prototype language.
- It started in web browsers but now it's used in many places like servers, mobile apps, and desktop programs.

#### Dart (2011)

- It was made for Flutter and tries to fix some problems with JavaScript.

#### TypeScript (2012)

- It's like JavaScript but with added types.

### Prototype Chain

- The biggest thing about prototype languages is that they make new objects from other objects, not from classes.
- These objects are connected by a prototype chain.
- If an object can't find something it needs, it looks up this chain to find it in a parent object.

```javascript
const person = {
  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};

const alice = Object.create(person);
alice.name = "Alice";

const employee = Object.create(alice);
employee.jobTitle = "Developer";
employee.sayJobTitle = function () {
  console.log(`My job title is ${this.jobTitle}`);
};

employee.sayHello(); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
employee.sayJobTitle(); // "My job title is Developer"
```

- This chain helps do things like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction in OOP.

### Why OOP is Hard in JavaScript

This can be confusing for people used to class-based OOP languages like Java.

- JavaScript added the 'class' keyword in ES6, but it's just a simpler way to write prototype-based code.

  - It doesn't change how JavaScript really works, so things like inheritance might not work as you expect.

- It's easy to add or change parts of an object in JavaScript. The rules are looser than in class-based languages.
- JavaScript doesn't directly support multiple inheritance.

  - You have to use special patterns like mixins to do this, which makes your code more complicated.

  ```javascript
  // Define a mixin function
  function mixin(target, ...sources) {
    Object.assign(target.prototype, ...sources);
  }

  ...

  // Apply mixins
  mixin(Animal, canSwim, canFly);
  ```

- JavaScript is also really good at functional programming.

  - This makes developers often prefer functional programming, which is different from OOP.

The best thing about JavaScript is that you can use many different ways of programming.

As the article suggests, good OOP in JavaScript might mean:

- Making small programs with data and methods to reuse code
- Using the simple parts of JavaScript
- Avoiding complicated structures
- Combining the good parts of functional programming

This way, you can use object-oriented ideas in JavaScript without making things too complex.
