- As our service grew, our RDS CPU usage kept increasing.
- We tried to fix this by improving our queries, but we hit a limit.
- We decided to scale up our RDS, but when we did, it caused about 5 minutes of downtime. This happened because we only had one RDS instance.
- To spread out CPU usage and update without stopping the service, we created a Read Replica and used TypeORM to send read-only queries to this slave.

#### 1. Changing the TypeORM Settings File

We changed the TypeORM settings file to set up a read-only connection.

- We use the `replication` setting to separate the master and slave.
- Even if your cluster only has one instance, you can put in the read endpoint of the AWS RDS cluster.
- Later, if you add more reader instances, read-only queries will automatically be spread out.

```ts
{
  type: 'postgres',
  replication: {
    master: {
      host: 'POSTGRESQL_HOST',
      port: 'POSTGRESQL_PORT',
      username: 'POSTGRESQL_USER',
      password: 'POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD',
      database: 'POSTGRESQL_DATABASE',
    },
    slaves: [
      {
        host: 'POSTGRESQL_RO_HOST',
        port: 'POSTGRESQL_PORT',
        username: 'POSTGRESQL_USER',
        password: 'POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD',
        database: 'POSTGRESQL_DATABASE',
      },
    ],
  },
  entities: [__dirname + 'ENTITY_PATH'],
  synchronize: false,
  logging: true,
};
```

#### 2. Creating an AWS RDS Read Replica

1. Log in to the AWS RDS console.
2. Choose your original RDS instance.
3. In the `Actions` menu, select `Add reader`.
4. Complete the necessary settings and create it.

#### 3. Monitoring

- Check if traffic to the writer instance is decreasing and spreading to the reader instance.
- After this, even if you scale up or down the writer instance, the reader will automatically change to become the writer.
  - There was a brief interruption during the switch, but no downtime.
  - We had to do a REINDEX operation again because the GIN index was broken.
