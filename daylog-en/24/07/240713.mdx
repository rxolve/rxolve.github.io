- In PostgreSQL, we can use the bigm_similarity function to search for similar strings.
- This is useful for fixing typos, searching for similar words, and fuzzy matching.
  - Fuzzy Matching: A way to figure out if differently spelled words are the same or just similar.
- While pg_trgm is often used for similarity searches, pg_bigm is better for Korean text.

#### Installing the pg_bigm extension

First, we need to turn on pg_bigm in the RDS parameter group:

1. Go to the AWS console and find RDS.
2. In the parameter group, find shared_preload_libraries and add pg_bigm.

```sql
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements,pg_bigm'
```

3. Connect to the database and create the extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_bigm;
```

#### Creating test data

- Let's make a simple product table for our example:

```PostgreSQL
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
);

INSERT INTO products (name) VALUES
('iPhone 15'),
('iPhone 15 Pro'),
('Samsung Galaxy S24'),
('Google Pixel 5'),
('OnePlus 9');
```

#### Implementing similarity search

- Now let's use bigm_similarity to search for similar items:

```sql
SELECT name, bigm_similarity(name, 'iphone') AS similarity
FROM products
WHERE bigm_similarity(name, 'iphone') > 0.3
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```

- This query finds product names similar to 'iphone' and sorts them by how similar they are.

```
name      | similarity
---------------+-----------
iPhone 12      |      0.5
iPhone 12 Pro  |    0.4375
```

#### Making it faster

- When searching through lots of data, it's good to use an index to make it faster:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_products_name_bigm ON products USING gin (name gin_bigm_ops);
```

- After making this index, we can search like this to use the index:

```sql
SELECT name, bigm_similarity(name, 'galxy') AS similarity
FROM products
WHERE name %> 'galxy' -- This uses the index
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```

- This query finds products similar to 'galxy' (a typo of Galaxy):

```
name              | similarity
-------------------+-----------
Samsung Galaxy S21 | 0.461538
```

#### Things to remember

- bigm_similarity doesn't care about capital letters.
- It might be slow with very long strings, so it's good to limit how long the text can be.
- The similarity threshold (0.3 in our example) needs to be adjusted based on your data.
  - You'll need to test a lot to find a good value.

#### Wrapping up

- Using bigm_similarity makes it easy to search for similar things in PostgreSQL.
  - This can really help make things better for users, especially when making search features.
- For more complex situations, you might want to combine this with full text search or try other similarity functions.
  - It's important to test how well it works with your real data and make it better if needed.
