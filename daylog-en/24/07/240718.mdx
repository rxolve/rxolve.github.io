## Remembering AngularJS

- My first web project was made with AngularJS.
- Even then, React was becoming popular, and AngularJS was seen as old.
- Now, AngularJS is no longer supported, and Angular has replaced it.
- Let's talk about what AngularJS left behind and how it's different from React.

## Comparing AngularJS and React

AngularJS came out in 2010 and was once very popular, but now it's gone. However, it still has an impact. Let's compare it with React to see what AngularJS left behind.

### 1. Component-Based Architecture

#### AngularJS

- Made the idea of component-based architecture popular.
- You could make reusable UI parts with "directives".

#### React

- Made component-based approach simpler and more flexible.
- Uses JSX to write components more easily.

### 2. Data Binding

#### AngularJS

- Introduced two-way data binding. Changes in the data automatically showed up in the view, and vice versa.
- Easy to use with the ng-model directive.

#### React

- Uses one-way data flow. This makes it easier to predict how the app's data will change.
- You need to update data explicitly using setState() or hooks.

### 3. Dependency Injection

#### AngularJS

- Brought dependency injection to frontend development.
- This made modules less dependent on each other and easier to test.
- It influenced backend frameworks like NestJS too.

#### React

- Uses props to pass data instead of dependency injection.
- You can get similar effects with Context API or libraries like Redux.

### 4. Template Syntax

#### AngularJS

- Used a template syntax that extended HTML (like ng-if, ng-repeat).
- This was easy for web developers to learn.

#### React

- Introduced JSX to write UI directly in JavaScript.
- This is more powerful but harder to learn at first.

### 5. Performance

#### AngularJS

- Had performance issues in big apps due to two-way data binding and digest cycle.

#### React

- Introduced virtual DOM for efficient UI updates.
- This works better in large applications.

## The Switch to Angular

- AngularJS became popular quickly, but it had some problems as time went on.
- So, the Google team decided to make a completely new framework called Angular (Angular 2+).

### Main Changes in Angular

- Uses TypeScript: Better for big apps and teamwork.
- Better performance: Improved how it detects changes.
- Mobile support: Made it work better on phones.
- Stronger component-based architecture: Removed some old concepts and focused more on components.

### Why Angular Didn't Become as Popular as AngularJS

- Hard to switch: Moving from AngularJS to Angular was like learning a new framework.
- React's rise: At the same time, React was growing fast because it was simple and flexible.
- Ecosystem changes: Many tools made for AngularJS didn't work with Angular.
- Version confusion: Angular updated too quickly, and developers found it hard to keep up.

## Conclusion

- AngularJS brought many new ideas to frontend development. Things like component-based architecture, data binding, and dependency injection are now common in modern frameworks. React took these ideas and made a more flexible and faster library, which is now very popular.
- The difficulties in switching to Angular show how important it is to choose the right technology and have a strong developer community. When adopting new tech, we need to think about how easy it is to learn, how easy it is to switch, and how much support it has.
- Understanding what AngularJS left behind helps us understand how modern frontend development has changed. It helps us see why modern frameworks like React are designed the way they are and what problems they're trying to solve.
