- If you can understand everything from the code alone, delete the comments.
- The purpose of writing code is to explain to other programmers what the computer should do.
  - Sometimes, comments and code don't match up when you look at them later.
- Sometimes, people who are too strict about communication insist on rules like "every routine must have a comment".
  - This leads to comments like:
    ```
    getX()
      # return X
      return X
    ```
  - This comment has no benefit and only costs time.
- Cleaning up code is often connected.

  - Sometimes, comments become redundant after you clean up the code.
  - Before:
    ```
    if (generator)
       ...code to set up generator...
    else
      # If there's no generator, return the default
      return getDefaultGenerator()
    ```
  - After: We clean it up by using a guard clause in the condition.

    ```
    if (!generator)
      # If there's no generator, return the default
      return getDefaultGenerator()

    ...code to set up generator...
    ```

  - At first, the comment wasn't redundant.
  - But after cleaning up the code, we can see the comment just repeats what the code says.
  - So let's delete it. Goodbye!
