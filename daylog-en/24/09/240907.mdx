In this post, we’ll create logic to control the snake using keyboard events.

### Idea

1. Add a `direction` state. Use the `Position` type, which holds `x` and `y` coordinates.
2. Change the `direction` state using keyboard events.
3. In the `moveSnake` function, use `direction` to calculate the new position of the snake’s head.

To do this, we need to know how to handle keyboard events in React.

### Handling Keyboard Events in React

Here’s how to handle keyboard events in React:

- Usually, we register keyboard events using `addEventListener` on the `window` object or a specific DOM element.
- Use properties like `ArrowUp` or `ArrowDown` to detect which key is pressed.
- Use `useEffect` to add and remove event listeners according to the component’s lifecycle.
- Don’t forget to clean up the event listener, or you might have memory leaks.

```typescript
const [direction, setDirection] = useState<Position>(INITIAL_DIRECTION);

//...

useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyPress = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    switch (e.key) {
      case "ArrowUp":
        setDirection([0, -1]);
        break;
      case "ArrowDown":
        setDirection([0, 1]);
        break;
      case "ArrowLeft":
        setDirection([-1, 0]);
        break;
      case "ArrowRight":
        setDirection([1, 0]);
        break;
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener("keydown", handleKeyPress);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener("keydown", handleKeyPress);
  };
}, []);
```

The `handleKeyPress` function takes a `KeyboardEvent` as a parameter.

It checks which key was pressed using the `key` property of the event object.

Then, it changes the `direction` state by calling the `setDirection` function.

### Modifying the `moveSnake` Function

Now, let’s modify the `moveSnake` function to use the new direction set by keyboard events.

```typescript
const moveSnake = useCallback(() => {
  const newSnake = [...snake];
  const head = newSnake[0];
  const newHead: Position = [
    // Calculate the new head position by adding the direction
    (head[0] + direction[0] + GRID_SIZE) % GRID_SIZE, // x coordinate
    (head[1] + direction[1] + GRID_SIZE) % GRID_SIZE, // y coordinate
  ];

  newSnake.pop();
  newSnake.unshift(newHead);
  setSnake(newSnake);
}, [snake]);
```

Now, instead of moving diagonally, you can control the snake based on the direction of the keyboard arrow keys.

In the next post, we’ll add collision detection and game over logic to make it more like a complete game.
