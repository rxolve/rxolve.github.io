In this book, we explore the interesting question: "Should we refactor code first?" This question is part of a larger economic tug-of-war.

- **Discounted cash flow** suggests making money first and spending it later, with a higher probability of success.
- **Options**, on the other hand, encourage spending money now, even if you don’t know the exact method yet, in the hope of making more money later.

Now, clearly, there are times when refactoring should come first. But when is that?

> **Cost (refactoring) + Cost (changing behavior after refactoring) < Cost (changing behavior right away)**

The more challenging situation is when:

> **Cost (refactoring) + Cost (changing behavior after refactoring) > Cost (changing behavior right away)**

Even if refactoring is more expensive in terms of discounted cash flow, it might still make sense economically if the value of the option created is greater than the value lost by spending money faster and with more certainty.

This is a critical decision point.

You might sense that there’s something valuable ahead, and you’ll need to refactor to see it clearly.

Or, you might feel that refactoring will make future changes easier and more enjoyable, so you decide to do it first.

However, always be aware that you might be acting against economic incentives.

We aim to develop two key forms of judgment to execute better decisions later:

- Becoming familiar with the incentives that affect the timing and scope of software design.
- Practicing interpersonal skills, first on ourselves and then extending them to coworkers, from close teammates to a broader range of colleagues.

By consistently practicing these, you’ll instinctively know when and how to design in those crucial moments that determine the survival and success of a product.
