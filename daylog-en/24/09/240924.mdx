The chapter lead shared this article with me.

The feature another team member is enhancing heavily relies on asynchronous background processing, so we’ve been discussing event-driven architecture.

Since event-driven patterns are unfamiliar to me, I wanted to read and summarize this article.

## Competing Consumer Pattern

The Competing Consumer Pattern is a method to increase system throughput and distribute load by having multiple consumers process messages simultaneously. This is a straightforward approach using queues.

### Key Features

- Multiple consumers retrieve and process messages from a queue at the same time.
- Each consumer operates independently, competing to take messages.
- Consumers can be added or removed dynamically based on the system's load.

### Advantages

- **Scalability**: When there are more messages to process, you can add more consumers to increase throughput.
- **High availability**: If one consumer fails, others can continue processing.
- **Load distribution**: Distributes tasks among multiple consumers, improving overall system performance.

### Considerations

- The message queue must support multiple consumers accessing it simultaneously.
- Each message should only be processed once (to avoid duplication).
- You need to decide how to distribute tasks between consumers (e.g., round-robin, weighted distribution).

## Retry Messages Pattern

The Retry Messages Pattern automatically retries processing messages that fail due to temporary errors.

### Main Components

- **Main Queue**: The queue for processing messages sequentially.
- **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**: A queue that stores messages that still fail after several retry attempts.
- **Retry Queue**: A temporary queue for messages that need to be retried.
- **Exponential Backoff Strategy**: A method where the retry intervals increase gradually.

### How It Works

1. When message processing fails, the message is moved to the Retry Queue.
2. After some time, the message is retrieved from the Retry Queue for another attempt.
3. If the retry fails, the system waits longer (following the exponential backoff strategy) and moves the message back to the Retry Queue.
4. If the maximum retry attempts are exceeded, the message is sent to the DLQ.

### Advantages

- Prevents message loss due to temporary errors.
- Increases the system’s resilience.
- The exponential backoff strategy helps avoid overwhelming the system.

### Considerations

- You need to set retry limits and intervals appropriately.
- It’s essential to monitor and manage messages in the DLQ.
- Ensure idempotency so that repeated processing of the same message doesn’t cause problems.

## Async Request-Response Pattern

The Async Request-Response Pattern overcomes the limitations of synchronous communication, improving system scalability and responsiveness.

### How It Works

1. The client sends a request to a message queue.
2. The server retrieves and processes the request from the queue.
3. Once processing is complete, the server sends a response to a separate response queue.
4. The client receives the response by polling the queue or through a callback.

### Key Components

- **Request Queue**: Stores the client’s requests.
- **Response Queue**: Stores the server’s responses.
- **Correlation ID**: A unique identifier used to match requests with responses.

### Advantages

- **Scalability**: Buffers the difference in processing speeds between the client and server.
- **Loose coupling**: Since the client and server aren’t directly connected, the system is more flexible.
- **Peak load management**: The request queue acts as a buffer to handle sudden spikes in load.

### Considerations

- Use correlation IDs to accurately match requests and responses.
- Implement timeout handling in case a response doesn’t arrive.
- Choose the appropriate method for receiving responses (polling or callback).

Understanding the characteristics of each pattern and combining them appropriately will help build a more robust and efficient system.

I'll keep an eye on how the implementation unfolds and think about where I can offer support.
