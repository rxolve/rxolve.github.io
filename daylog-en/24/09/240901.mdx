On the first day of fall, I want to take some time to reflect on this past summer.

I opened my blog on June 1st and wrote the first post.
Since then, I’ve been posting one article a day, and now there are 91 posts.
I wondered if anyone would visit, but around 10 people come each day.
I’m grateful to everyone who has visited.

Most of my posts have been about summarizing the book "Tidy First?".
As I summarized the author’s words, it felt almost like meditation.
I learned a lot from the wisdom of the expert.

I also wrote posts about algorithms, covering topics like merge sort, Tim sort, DP, and trees.
I tried to define problems as simply as possible and solve them in the easiest way I could think of.

As I added more features to the blog, I learned more about Next.js.
I worked on things like syntax highlighting, tags, SEO, visitor counting, a logo, and applying PicoCSS and Tailwind.
The most viewed post was about shadcn. It showed me what developers are interested in these days.

For JavaScript and TypeScript, I wrote posts whenever I encountered something unclear in my work.

I did the same for RDS, with many posts focusing on PostgreSQL, which I use in my job.
One of the tasks I focused on the most this summer was restructuring RDS for easier scaling and building a monitoring system.

I use NestJS daily at work, but I haven’t written many posts about it.
I think it’s because I’m already familiar with it and don’t find it challenging.

I also went on a summer vacation with friends.
During that time, I set aside the blog and focused on truly relaxing.

By the end of fall, I expect to have written another 90 posts.
I’ve already picked the next book to summarize after finishing "Tidy First?".
I’m also working on a snake game and want to add fun features to it before releasing it for free on the App Store.
I’m planning to create a Binance trading bot because I’m not good at investing, so I want to make a friend who’s better at it than me.
I’d also like to write a series on LLMs, but I haven’t decided on the structure yet. I’m always grateful to GPT and Claude.

This fall, I plan to focus on writing posts about the projects I’m working on.
I hope I can share deeper thoughts and experiences.
