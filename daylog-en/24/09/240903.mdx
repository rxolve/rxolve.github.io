Software creates value in two ways:

- What the software does now
- The potential to do new things in the future

There are two ways to define how it works:

- Input-output pairs: For example, when considering hourly wage, work hours, and tax rates, the salary and tax report will be calculated accordingly.
- Invariant conditions: The total amount of financial support from the government should equal the total amount of all deductions.

**Functionality creates value.**

If it costs $1 in electricity to run the software and you can charge $10 when people use it, you’ve established a business.

The author learned over decades that **you don’t always have to change how a system works to make it more valuable.**

As soon as you create a **choice of what to do next**, you've already made money.

Options are the economic magic that software creates, mainly by providing opportunities for growth.

Just because you can build 1,000 cars doesn’t mean you can build 100,000 cars.

But in software, if you can send 1,000 notifications, with the right effort, you could send 100,000.

One of the best things about options is that the more uncertain the environment, the more valuable the options become.

Once you learn how to increase choices through options, chaos turns into opportunity.

What takes away these choices?

- A key employee leaves. What used to take a few days to change now takes months.
- You lose touch with your customers. If you used to get one request a day but now only get one a month, your options narrow.
- The cost of making changes increases. You can’t make a decision every day; now, you only get the chance once a month. As your options decrease, so does the value your software creates.

This book doesn’t directly address the first two issues, but it can help with the third one. It’s like keeping your kitchen clean while cooking.

The structure of the system doesn’t affect how it works, but it does create future opportunities.

The problem is that structure isn’t as obvious as functionality.

This is why people get confused about changing the structure versus changing how the system works.

Understanding that structure changes and functionality changes both create value, but in fundamentally different ways, is the first step.

How are they different? In a word: **reversibility**.
