TypeScript and Kotlin were both created to overcome the limitations of JavaScript and Java, respectively.

(Even though JavaScript only got its name from Java, there are still some conceptual similarities.)

Looking at Kotlin again after a few years, I realized that these two languages are surprisingly similar.

## Static Type System

### TypeScript

TypeScript introduced a static type system to address the instability caused by JavaScript’s flexible dynamic typing.

It allows you to gradually add types to existing JavaScript code, improving the safety and maintainability of large-scale applications.

```javascript
// JavaScript: Problems with dynamic typing
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b; // The types of 'a' and 'b' are unclear
}

console.log(add(5, "5")); // '55'
```

```typescript
// TypeScript: Safety with static typing
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b; // 'a' and 'b' are fixed as number types
}

console.log(add(5, 5)); // 10
```

TypeScript prevents type errors at the time of writing code, ensuring predictable behavior.

### Kotlin

Kotlin also improves Java’s type system by catching errors at compile time and allowing you to write safer code.

One of Kotlin’s biggest advantages is its Null Safety feature, which effectively prevents runtime errors caused by null references.

```java
// Java: Potential NullPointerException
String name = null;
System.out.println(name.length()); // NPE occurs

// Kotlin: Safe code with Null Safety
val name: String? = null
println(name?.length) // Safe call
```

Both TypeScript and Kotlin maximize code safety in their respective platforms with advanced type systems.

## Functional Programming

### TypeScript

Since TypeScript is based on JavaScript, it supports convenient syntax for functional programming.

With higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and closures, you can write more readable code and reduce side effects.

```typescript
// TypeScript: Higher-order functions and lambda expressions
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

### Kotlin

Kotlin offers even more powerful functional programming features compared to Java.

Its lambda expressions and higher-order functions make code more concise, and by emphasizing immutability, they enable safe parallel processing.

In addition, scope functions like `with` and `apply` allow for more intuitive object initialization and configuration.

```kotlin
// Kotlin: Lambda expressions and scope functions
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
val doubled = numbers.map { it * 2 }
println(doubled) // [2, 4, 6, 8]

data class User(var name: String, var age: Int)

val user = User("John", 30).apply {
    age += 1 // More concise code with scope functions
}
println(user) // User(name=John, age=31)
```

Both TypeScript and Kotlin enhance the developer experience by embracing the benefits of functional programming.

## Flexibility and Compatibility

### TypeScript

One of TypeScript’s biggest strengths is its compatibility with existing JavaScript code.

You can gradually introduce TypeScript into existing projects and choose not to apply types when unnecessary.

This allows teams to adopt TypeScript step-by-step while still leveraging the existing JavaScript ecosystem.

```typescript
// JavaScript code can be used as is
const message = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message);
```

### Kotlin

Kotlin guarantees 100% compatibility with Java.

You can use existing Java code as is, or use Java libraries without any issues in Kotlin.

This lowers the barrier for adopting Kotlin in existing Java projects, and makes it easier for Java developers to transition to Kotlin.

Additionally, Kotlin’s extension functions allow for more convenient use of existing Java APIs.

```kotlin
// Perfect compatibility with Java code
val list = ArrayList<String>()
list.add("Hello")
list.add("Kotlin")

// More concise code with Kotlin’s extension functions
list.forEach { println(it) }
```

Both TypeScript and Kotlin emphasize compatibility with existing ecosystems, reducing the burden of adopting a new language and improving the developer experience.

## Multi-Platform Support

### TypeScript

Like JavaScript, TypeScript can be used in various environments such as browsers, Node.js, mobile, and desktop.

With frameworks like React Native, you can even develop mobile applications using TypeScript.

### Kotlin

In addition to JVM-based applications, Kotlin can be compiled to JavaScript and native platforms using Kotlin/JS and Kotlin/Native.

This allows you to share common code across platforms such as Android, iOS, and web applications.

## Conclusion

Of course, TypeScript and Kotlin have fundamentally different paradigms.

However, they both offer modern features that make them surprisingly similar in many aspects.

Just as NestJS and Spring Boot share similarities, TypeScript and Kotlin provide a similar development experience on different platforms.
