Over the weekend, I organized my resume.

I recently saw a resume from a developer who used to work at Google, and I was impressed.

I wanted to make mine just as simple and impactful.

But no matter how much I trimmed it, I couldn’t fit everything on one page.

So, I ended up with a two-page resume.

When I showed it to my former CTO, I received a long, detailed feedback early this morning.

To summarize:

1. Include which problems I tackled in each project, the hypotheses I made, and how I implemented them to get results.
2. Add quantifiable metrics.
3. Highlight troubleshooting experiences.

He thought adding these points would make my resume more valuable.

I was really grateful for his feedback, especially considering how busy he is.

After that, I spent the early hours of the morning thinking about how to reorganize my resume.

Looking back and organizing the problems I solved and the results I achieved is a mentally exhausting process that takes time.

The difficulties, passion, and realizations I had back then are important stories of my life and things companies would want to know.

But putting all that into the right words isn’t easy.

I also thought it would have been great if I had started this blog earlier.

And I realized how much time and effort must have gone into that Google developer’s impressive resume.

It seems like it will take more time to create a resume that I’m really happy with.

I just hope that, when it’s done, it will be something people can easily read and enjoy.
