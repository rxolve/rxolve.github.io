## Basis

In linear algebra, a basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that generate a vector space.

There are two key properties of a basis:

1. **Linear Independence**: None of the vectors in the basis can be written as a combination of the others.
2. **Span**: Every vector in the space can be represented as a combination of the basis vectors.

## Basis in Database Design

I thought this concept could be applied to database design, especially in the process of normalization.

### Database as a Vector Space

Imagine a database as a vector space:

- Each 'vector' represents a possible state of the database.
- 'Dimensions' represent the independent data elements in the database.

### Normalized Schema as a Basis

A normalized database schema can be seen as the basis of this vector space.

1. **Linear Independence**

   - Each normalized table (or column) holds unique information.
   - No table (or column) can be completely derived from others.

2. **Span**

   - By combining the normalized tables, you can represent any possible state of the original data.
   - Join operations are like 'linear combinations.'

## Normalization: Finding the Best Basis

The normalization process can be thought of as finding the 'optimal basis.'

### 1st Normal Form (1NF): Atomicity

- Goal: Ensure each column holds only one value.
- Linear algebra view: Ensure each 'dimension' contains a single scalar value.

### 2nd Normal Form (2NF): Removing Partial Dependencies

- Goal: Remove partial functional dependencies.
- Linear algebra view: Separate 'dimensions' that depend only on parts of a vector.

### 3rd Normal Form (3NF): Removing Transitive Dependencies

- Goal: Remove transitive functional dependencies.
- Linear algebra view: Separate 'dimensions' that are indirectly determined by others.

## Benefits and Cautions of the Basis Perspective

This perspective offers real insights into database design beyond a simple analogy.

It gives us a new way to think about tasks like reducing redundancy, optimizing queries, and expanding schemas.

However, real-world data often has non-linear relationships, and in practice, we sometimes use denormalization to avoid too many joins. So, it's not a perfect analogy.

But it was enjoyable to connect familiar mathematical concepts to practical work.
