We can now say that "software design" means "Beneficially Relating Elements".

This is a short phrase, but it holds an important concept. Each word carries significant weight.

So, what is design? Design is about the elements that make up something, the relationships between those elements, and the benefits that come from those relationships.

What does a designer do? A designer relates elements in a beneficial way.

A designer can only do the following things:

- Create and delete elements.
- Create and delete relationships.
- Enhance the benefits of relationships.

Here’s the author’s favorite example:

- Before:

```
caller()
    return box.width() * box.height()
```

- After:

```
caller()
    return box.area()

Box>>area()
    return width() * height()
```

From a design perspective, a new element called `Box.area()` was created, and the relationship between the `caller()` function and the `box` object was adjusted.

Now, these two elements are connected by a single function call.

Regarding the structure of the system, it includes:

- The hierarchy of elements
- The relationships between elements
- The benefits that come from these relationships

Now is the time to more clearly distinguish between the structure and behavior of the system.
