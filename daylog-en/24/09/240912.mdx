Previously, we learned about insertion operations in a 2-3 tree.

This time, let's look at the deletion process in a 2-3 tree.

#### Features of Deletion in a 2-3 Tree

- After deletion, all leaf nodes must stay at the same depth.
- Special handling is needed when deleting a key from a 2-node.
- If you delete a key from an internal node, you need to replace it with its successor or predecessor.

#### Steps for Deletion in a 2-3 Tree

Let's go through the steps of deleting a value from a 2-3 tree.

1. Finding the Key to Delete

- Start from the root and search the tree until you find the key to delete.

2. Deleting from a Leaf Node

- If the key is in a leaf node, delete it directly.
- If it’s in a 3-node, just remove the key and you’re done.
- If it’s in a 2-node, additional steps are needed (see “Handling Underflow” below).

3. Deleting from an Internal Node

- If the key is in an internal node, replace it with its successor or predecessor.
- After replacing, the problem becomes deleting from a leaf node.

4. Handling Underflow

- Deleting from a 2-node will leave the node empty, causing "underflow."
- You can either borrow a key from a sibling (redistribution) or merge with the parent and sibling.

5. Propagating Changes

- If necessary, changes are propagated up to the root.
- If the root becomes empty, the tree's height may decrease.

#### Example

Let’s delete the number 7 from the following 2-3 tree.

```
         [9]
        /   \
     [5]     [15]
    /   \    /   \
 [2,3] [7] [10] [17,20]
```

1. Find and delete 7: the [7] node becomes empty.
2. We need to fix the underflow:
   - Borrow the 3 from the left sibling [2,3].
   - Move 5 from the parent into the empty spot.
   - Move 3 up to the parent.
3. Apply the changes.

The result is:

```
         [9]
        /   \
     [3]     [15]
    /   \    /   \
 [2]   [5] [10] [17,20]
```

#### Ways to Handle Underflow

1. Redistribution (Borrowing from Sibling)

   - If a sibling is a 3-node, you can borrow a key from it.
   - Rearrange the keys from the sibling, parent, and current node.

2. Merging
   - If the sibling is a 2-node, you need to merge.
   - Move the parent’s key down to the sibling and remove the empty node.
   - This can cause the parent to also underflow, so it might need to be fixed recursively.

#### Summary of the Deletion Process

#### Conclusion

Deletion in a 2-3 tree can be more complex than insertion.

However, once you understand this process, it will be easier to understand deletion in other balanced tree structures too.
