This time, let's create the logic to move the snake.

#### Animations using setInterval

The easiest way to create animations in React is by using the `setInterval` function.

To call the moveSnake function every 0.5 seconds, you can implement it like this:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const gameLoop = setInterval(moveSnake, 500);
  return () => clearInterval(gameLoop);
}, [moveSnake]);
```

We use `clearInterval` to stop the `setInterval` when the component is unmounted.

If the timer keeps running after the component is unmounted, it can cause memory leaks.

When the dependencies change, the useEffect hook runs again, removing the old interval and setting a new one.

#### The moveSnake Function

Let’s implement the moveSnake function, which moves the snake one space diagonally on the board.

```typescript
const moveSnake = useCallback(() => {
  const newSnake = [...snake];
  const head = newSnake[0];
  const newHead: Position = [
    (head[0] + 1 + GRID_SIZE) % GRID_SIZE,
    (head[1] + 1 + GRID_SIZE) % GRID_SIZE,
  ];

  newSnake.pop();
  newSnake.unshift(newHead);
  setSnake(newSnake);
}, [snake]);
```

We get the current position of the snake’s head and calculate the new position.

Here, both the x and y coordinates increase by 1.

By using `% GRID_SIZE`, the snake will reappear from the opposite side of the board if it goes out of bounds.

`pop()` removes the last tail of the snake, and `unshift(newHead)` adds a new head.

Finally, we use the `useCallback` hook to create a memoized callback function.

It was simpler than expected to make the snake move.

Now it’s starting to look more like a snake!

Next time, we’ll add keyboard input to control the snake however we like.
