I recently visited my mom's house and pulled out an old book.

It was _Joel on Software_, and I found an interesting algorithm inside.

There was a Russian painter who was painting lines on the road.

On his first day, he took a paint bucket and painted 300 yards.

His boss was amazed and said, "Wow, that's really impressive! You're very fast!" The boss gave him 1 kopeck as a reward.

The next day, the painter only painted 150 yards.

Still, the boss said, "Hmm, not as much as yesterday, but still, you're fast. 150 yards is great too," and gave him another 1 kopeck.

But on the third day, the painter only painted 30 yards.

The boss was furious and said, "Just 30 yards?! This is unacceptable! You painted more than 10 times this amount on your first day! What's wrong?"

The painter, feeling sad, replied, "I couldn't help it. Every day, I have to walk farther from the paint bucket."

There’s a line in the book that says, "If you have time, why not calculate the exact numbers?" That’s where I got involved.

```typescript
"use client";

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";

interface DailyWork { // Daily work result
  day: number; // Day number
  yards: number; // Yards painted that day
  payment: number; // Payment received (kopecks)
}

const RussianPainter: React.FC = () => {
  const [days, setDays] = useState<number>(3); // Number of work days (default: 3)
  const [startYards, setStartYards] = useState<number>(300); // Starting yards (default: 300 yards)
  const [results, setResults] = useState<DailyWork[]>([]); // Daily work results
  const [totalYards, setTotalYards] = useState<number>(0); // Total yards painted
  const [totalPayment, setTotalPayment] = useState<number>(0); // Total payment received

  const russianPainter = (days: number, startYards: number): DailyWork[] => {
    const result: DailyWork[] = [];

    const paint = (day: number, yards: number): void => { // Recursively calculate daily work
      if (day > days) return; // Stop after the specified number of days

      const payment = yards >= 30 ? 1 : 0; // 1 kopeck if more than 30 yards painted
      result.push({ day, yards, payment });

      const nextYards = Math.floor(yards / 2); // Next day's work is half of the previous day
      paint(day + 1, nextYards); // Calculate the next day (recursion)
    };

    paint(1, startYards); // Start on the first day
    return result;
  };

  const handleRun = () => {
    const workDays = russianPainter(days, startYards);
    setResults(workDays);

    const total = workDays.reduce( // Calculate total yards and payment
      (acc, day) => ({
        yards: acc.yards + day.yards,
        payment: acc.payment + day.payment,
      }),
      { yards: 0, payment: 0 }
    );

    setTotalYards(total.yards);
    setTotalPayment(total.payment);
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-4 max-w-md mx-auto">

              Day {day}: Painted {yards} yards, Received {payment} kopeck

          <p>Total payment received: {totalPayment} kopecks</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default RussianPainter;
```
