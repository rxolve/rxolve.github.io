Does "more" or "less" always mean the same thing? It depends on the situation.

When it comes to money, there are two factors:

- Time
- Certainty

A promise of $1 tomorrow is worth less than receiving $1 today.

How do we evaluate the value of a software system? How much is reasonable to pay?

When buying, what interests me is how the money flows.

To assess the value of software, we can model it as a series of cash flows—some money coming in, some going out (this is key)—and each flow is closely tied to time.

Here’s an exercise to build intuition about time and money:

Which software system is more attractive? One that costs $10 million and earns $20 million over 10 years, or one that costs $10 million and earns $12 million?

Strictly speaking, this question is a trap.

To build your intuition, you should immediately ask, "Okay, but when, and how certain is it?"

Compare these scenarios: "I pay $10 million today and get $20 million in 10 years" vs. "I receive $12 million today and pay $10 million in 10 years."

The first deal makes me nervous. The second one makes me excited about the next 10 years.

In this book, we focus on the time value of money, suggesting that it's better to delay cleaning up code rather than doing it early.

If you can practice making money now and cleaning code later, you’ll eventually learn to earn first and spend later.

This exercise on the value of time will be useful when we dive into larger-scale examples in future books.

Next, we’ll look at another source of a software's economic value: optionality.

It’ll be a fun journey, as time value and optionality often clash.
