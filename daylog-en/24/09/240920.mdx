James Buchan, in his book _Frozen Desire_, says that people often want something but don’t need it right away, and that money represents this kind of `frozen desire`.

But money is a strange thing. It has its own nature.

When a person’s desire clashes with the power of money, money usually wins. In the end, it always does.

What I’ve learned about money is that it has two surprising qualities:

- Earning money quickly is important because $1 today is worth more than $1 tomorrow. So, we try to earn money fast but spend it as late as possible.
- In uncertain times, having options is better than having the thing itself. So, we create options to deal with uncertainty.

These two qualities can sometimes conflict.

If you try to earn money now, you might lose future options.

But if you don’t make money now, you may not be able to use your options in the future.

After looking closely at how money’s value changes over time and how options work, we’ll explore how these ideas relate to software design.
