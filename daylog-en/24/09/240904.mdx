I'm planning to create a trading bot for Binance.

Last month, I started trading futures on Binance for the first time.

Then, almost as if it was waiting for me, the Nasdaq crashed, and the paired Bitcoin dropped by 24% in just 8 days.

I had placed a 10x long bet, and I experienced my first liquidation.

I added more funds to recover my losses, but I ended up getting liquidated five more times.

It wasn't a huge amount of money, but I had to admit it—I’m not good at investing.

So, I've decided to build a trading bot that can do better than me.

I'll be using the Binance API.

In the next post, I’ll start by creating a feature to fetch Bitcoin's current price.

What will be the outcome of this project? I’m excited to find out.
