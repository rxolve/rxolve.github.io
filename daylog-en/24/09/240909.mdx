Here are some of the popular Node-based admin frameworks:

- Strapi, KeystoneJS, AdminJS, LoopBack, Forest Admin, Sails.js, etc.

Among these, I chose AdminJS for the following reasons:

- It supports various ORMs like TypeORM and already has many adapters, making it easy to connect.
- By just defining the entities, it automatically provides CRUD functionality.
- It comes with basic filtering features, so you don't need to implement search functions yourself.
- In addition to the default actions (CRUD), you can easily create custom logic. This is especially useful when creating custom actions for bulk resources.
- It uses a React-based design system and supports `styled-components`.
- You can enhance the admin functions by creating your own features or using features developed by the open-source community.
- Most importantly, it works very well with NestJS, allowing you to use middleware like Guards, Interceptors, and Pipes.

Below is a sample code that adds the TypeORM adapter to the default project structure from the official website.

You can see the basic operation of AdminJS.

```typescript
import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";

import { AppController } from "./app.controller";
import { AppService } from "./app.service";
import * as AdminJSTypeorm from "@adminjs/typeorm";
import AdminJS from "adminjs";

const DEFAULT_ADMIN = {
  email: "admin@example.com",
  password: "password",
};

const authenticate = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  if (email === DEFAULT_ADMIN.email && password === DEFAULT_ADMIN.password) {
    return Promise.resolve(DEFAULT_ADMIN);
  }
  return null;
};

AdminJS.registerAdapter({
  Resource: Resource,
  Database: Database,
});

@Module({
  imports: [
    // AdminJS version 7 is ESM-only. In order to import it, you have to use dynamic imports.
    import("@adminjs/nestjs").then(({ AdminModule }) =>
      AdminModule.createAdminAsync({
        useFactory: () => ({
          adminJsOptions: {
            rootPath: "/admin",
            resources: [],
          },
          auth: {
            authenticate,
            cookieName: "adminjs",
            cookiePassword: "secret",
          },
          sessionOptions: {
            resave: true,
            saveUninitialized: true,
            secret: "secret",
          },
        }),
      })
    ),
    TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync(typeORMConfig),
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

AdminJS allows you to inject everything from entities to styles, and its custom components are highly reusable.

It’s a great tool and a project worth learning more about.

Let’s explore it step by step from now on.
