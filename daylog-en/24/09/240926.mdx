JavaScript's event loop is an important concept that allows it to handle asynchronous tasks, even though it is single-threaded. Let's break down how it works.

To understand the event loop, we need to know how the call stack, event queue, and event loop interact with each other.

## Call Stack

- JavaScript runs on a single thread, meaning it can only handle one task at a time.
- The currently executing function or code block is placed in the `call stack`, and once it finishes, it is removed from the stack.
- For example, if function `a` calls function `b`, `a` will be added to the stack first, and then `b` will be added on top.
  - When `b` finishes, it is removed from the stack.
  - Then, `a` continues its execution.

## Event Queue (Task Queue)

- When an asynchronous task (like a timer, network request, or DOM event) completes, its callback function is added to the `event queue`.
- The callbacks in the event queue wait until the call stack is empty, meaning all synchronous tasks have finished, to be executed.

## Event Loop

- The event loop constantly monitors the call stack and the event queue.
- If the call stack is empty, the event loop moves a callback from the event queue to the call stack for execution.
- This allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous callbacks even after all synchronous code has run.

## Macro Tasks and Micro Tasks

To fully understand the order of the event loop, we need to differentiate between macro tasks and micro tasks.

#### Macro Tasks

- Macro tasks include timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`), I/O tasks, and event handlers.
- Macro tasks are executed one at a time from the event queue when the call stack is empty.

#### Micro Tasks

- Micro tasks include `then`, `catch`, and `finally` from promises.
- Micro tasks are executed before the next macro task. So, after a macro task finishes, all micro tasks are executed before moving to the next macro task.

## Event Loop Example

```javascript
console.log("start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("setTimeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("promise");
});

console.log("end");
```

1. `console.log('start')` is added to the call stack and executed.
2. `setTimeout` registers its callback as a macro task in the event queue.
3. `Promise.resolve().then` registers its callback as a micro task in the micro task queue.
4. `console.log('end')` is added to the call stack and executed.
5. Once the call stack is empty, the event loop first checks the micro task queue and executes the `promise` message.
6. After the micro task queue is empty, the event loop takes the `setTimeout` callback from the macro task queue and executes it, printing the `setTimeout` message.

This way, the event loop helps JavaScript handle asynchronous tasks efficiently, ensuring a smooth user experience.
