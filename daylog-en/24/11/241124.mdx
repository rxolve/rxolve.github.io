Digital Rights Management (DRM) refers to a system of technologies and policies designed to prevent unauthorized copying, distribution, and modification of digital content, ensuring that only authorized users have access.  
Content creators and distributors utilize DRM to protect their intellectual property by encrypting content and providing 'keys' (licenses) exclusively to authorized users.

#### Key Technical Components of DRM

- Encryption and Key Management

  - Content is encrypted using symmetric key algorithms, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot view the material.
  - The random keys used for encryption are securely managed by the DRM server, and when a user plays the content, a license is issued to decrypt the key.

- License Management and Issuance

  - When a user requests content, the DRM system verifies the user's authentication information (e.g., ID/password, device authentication, biometrics) and issues a license that matches the usage rights and conditions.
  - The license includes key information necessary for content decryption and usage conditions (e.g., number of allowable plays, expiration time, access restrictions).

- Packaging and Secure Containers

  - DRM packages the content (videos, e-books, music, etc.) in an encrypted state and delivers it securely along with additional protective metadata.
  - During this process, additional security technologies such as digital signatures or watermarking may be applied.

- Access Control and Authentication

  - DRM strictly limits the users or devices that can access the content.
  - User authentication is enhanced through various methods beyond simple ID/passwords, including digital certificates, single sign-on (SSO), and biometrics.

- Usage Logging and Monitoring

  - DRM tracks usage records of the content to monitor for illegal copying or abnormal usage patterns.
  - If necessary, forensic watermarking can be used to trace the source of unauthorized leaks.

#### Examples of DRM Application in Services

- Video Streaming Services

  - Examples: Netflix, TVING, Watcha
  - Applied Technologies: Utilizing technologies like Google Widevine, Apple FairPlay, and Microsoft PlayReady, content is encrypted across various platforms (Android, iOS, Windows), ensuring that only legitimate licenses are provided to users to prevent illegal copying.

- E-Book Services

  - Examples: Kyobo Book Centre, Ridibooks, Yes24
  - Applied Technologies: Each service employs its own DRM system to prevent unauthorized copying or sharing of e-book files. Users can access purchased e-books only through dedicated apps or viewers.

- Music Streaming and Download Services

  - Examples: Melon, Genie Music, Bugs
  - Applied Technologies: DRM encrypts music files and manages licenses to ensure that only authorized users can play the music, preventing illegal downloads and copying.

- Games and Software

  - Examples: For PC games, DRM solutions like SecuROM and Denuvo are used to prevent illegal copying and hacking.
  - Applied Technologies: During game execution, communication with authentication servers ensures genuine verification before allowing the game to run, thereby blocking the distribution of pirated games.

- Digital Content Distribution Platforms

  - Examples: OTT services, e-learning platforms
  - Applied Technologies: In the distribution process of digital content such as lecture videos, webtoons, and online course materials, DRM is applied to ensure that content is delivered only to authorized users, minimizing illegal copying or distribution.

#### Conclusion

DRM is a comprehensive protection system that goes beyond merely encrypting content.  
it encompasses license management, access control, user authentication, and detection of illegal usage.  
By applying DRM across various digital content services, creators and distributors can safeguard their revenue and provide legitimate users with a stable content experience.  
As seen in various examples, DRM has established itself as a key security solution in fields such as video streaming, e-books, music, and games.
