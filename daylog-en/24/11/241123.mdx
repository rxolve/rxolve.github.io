When using Swagger to automatically generate API documentation, circular dependency errors often occur.

## How Swagger Extracts Metadata

The Swagger plugin in NestJS utilizes TypeScript decorators to read property and type information from each class.  
For example, consider the following class:

```typescript
export class User {
  @ApiProperty({ description: "User name", example: "John Doe" })
  name: string;

  @ApiProperty({ description: "User age", example: 30 })
  age: number;
}
```

Swagger generates the schema for the `User` class based on the metadata provided through the `@ApiProperty` decorator.  
During this process, it recursively analyzes the type of each field (e.g., string, number, or nested object) to construct the final schema.

## Difference Between Regular Classes and Enums

#### In the Case of Classes

Regular classes contain instance properties and methods.  
When analyzing these classes, Swagger scans all properties and their types within the class.  
For example, the following class structure allows Swagger to document its schema correctly:

```typescript
@Entity()
export class Job {
  @ManyToOne(() => Customer, (customer) => customer.jobs)
  @ApiProperty({ type: () => Customer }) // Using a lazy resolver
  customer: Customer;
}
```

#### In the Case of Enums

Enums are simply a collection of constant values.  
Since they do not contain instance properties like a class, if Swagger mistakenly treats an enum as a regular class and tries to analyze its structure, issues arise.  
For example, the following incorrect approach can cause Swagger to attempt a recursive analysis of the enum’s values, leading to a circular dependency error:

```typescript
@ApiProperty({
  description: 'Customer information',
  type: Customer, // ❌ Incorrectly treating an enum as a class
  nullable: false,
})
customer: Customer;
```

## Cause of the Circular Dependency Issue

Swagger assumes that the given type is a regular class and attempts to recursively scan its internal properties.  
However, enums do not contain actual instance properties—only constant values exist within them.  
Thus, when Swagger tries to analyze an enum:

- It may attempt to recursively explore internal values.
- It may try to extract unexpected metadata, leading to a circular reference structure.

In such cases, Swagger throws an error:  
"A circular dependency has been detected."

This issue is particularly common when an entity with a bidirectional relationship contains an enum, as Swagger may get stuck in an infinite loop while exploring its structure.

## Correct Solution: Using the `enum` Option

The solution is simple—explicitly indicate that the type is an enum by using the `enum` option in `@ApiProperty`.

```typescript
@ApiProperty({
  description: 'Customer information',
  enum: Customer, // ✅ Correctly specifying the type as an enum
  nullable: false,
})
customer: Customer;
```

With this approach, Swagger recognizes `Customer` as an enum, not a class, and directly includes its defined constant values in the schema.  
Since recursive analysis is no longer needed, the circular dependency issue is avoided.

## Conclusion

NestJS Swagger recursively explores type information when generating class-based model schemas.  
However, since enums are simple collections of constant values, treating them the same way as classes can cause circular dependency issues.

To prevent this, always use the `enum` option instead of `type` when defining an enum in Swagger.  
By understanding how Swagger processes metadata and applying the correct options, you can generate clean API documentation without circular dependency errors.
