When operating AdminJS, you may encounter various challenges with session management in a multi-instance (or scale-out) environment that simply don’t appear on a single server.  
Here, we’ll explore why session sharing is important and review the most common methods to address it.

## Why Is Session Sharing Necessary in a Multi-Instance Environment?

HTTP is inherently a stateless protocol.  
This means each request from a client is processed independently, so to maintain state information such as login status or user-specific settings, sessions are required.  
On a single server, storing sessions in memory is sufficient; however, in an environment where a load balancer distributes requests across multiple servers (instances), the session information stored on one server is not available on the others, which leads to issues.

For example, if a user logs in and the first request creates a session on Server A, but subsequent requests are directed to Server B, Server B will not have that session information and will require re-authentication.  
To solve this issue, all instances must share the session information.

## Representative Solutions for Session Sharing

There are three primary methods to implement session sharing in a multi-instance environment.

#### Sticky Session

Sticky Session is a method where the load balancer always directs a specific user’s request to the server where the session was initially created.  
In other words, based on the information stored in the client’s cookie, requests are fixed to a particular server so that the session stored in that server’s memory can be reused.

Advantages:

- Resolves the issue without requiring additional session-sharing infrastructure.
- Simple to implement.

Disadvantages:

- Traffic can become concentrated on a specific server.
- If that server fails, all users connected to it are affected.

> The Sticky Session approach might serve as a short-term solution, but it has limitations in terms of availability and scalability.

#### Session Clustering

Session clustering is a feature provided by web application servers (e.g., Tomcat) that replicates session information created on one server to other servers in real time.  
In this method, the user’s session is replicated and stored across multiple servers, ensuring that regardless of which server handles the request, the same session data is available.

Advantages:

- Maintains session consistency regardless of which server is accessed.
- Allows other servers to immediately take over in case of a failure.

Disadvantages:

- As the number of servers increases, the overhead from replication (in terms of memory and network usage) also increases.
- There are performance limitations in large-scale cluster environments.
  > Note that Tomcat’s all-to-all session replication method is generally suitable for small clusters.

#### Using External Session Storage (e.g., Redis)

The most common and scalable solution is to adopt an external session storage system (such as Redis or Memcached).  
In this approach, each instance does not store sessions in its own memory; instead, all instances access a centralized storage system to read and write session information.

Example code (Node.js Express + Redis):

```javascript
const session = require("express-session");
const RedisStore = require("connect-redis")(session);
const redis = require("redis");

const redisClient = redis.createClient({
  host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
  port: process.env.REDIS_PORT,
  // Additional configuration for authentication if needed
});

app.use(
  session({
    store: new RedisStore({ client: redisClient }),
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: { secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" },
  })
);
```

Advantages:

- Since all servers reference a centralized storage, the session inconsistency issue is completely resolved.
- Provides scalability and high availability (with replication and clustering options available).

Disadvantages:

- Requires the setup and maintenance of separate infrastructure.
- Potential issues such as network latency may arise due to the nature of external storage.

> Many projects prefer using Redis because it integrates easily with various frameworks such as Spring and Node.js.

## Considerations When Choosing a Method

- Traffic Volume: For small-scale environments, Sticky Sessions or session clustering might suffice, but for high-traffic environments, external session storage is a safer bet.
- Availability: It’s important not to depend on a single instance; prepare for failures by configuring replication on the centralized storage.
- Operational Complexity: Additional infrastructure setup and monitoring are required, so consider your team’s operational capabilities when choosing a solution.

## Conclusion

The session sharing issue in a multi-instance environment is critical not only from a development perspective but also in terms of operations and scalability.  
Generally, using an external session storage solution (particularly Redis) is the most widely adopted approach, as it ensures both stability and scalability.  
Of course, each method has its own pros and cons, so it is essential to choose the optimal method based on your service’s characteristics and traffic volume.  
For our in-house admin system, I plan to configure Sticky Sessions.
