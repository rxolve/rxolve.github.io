## What is Exponential Backoff?

Exponential backoff is a retry strategy that gradually increases the waiting time between retries when a temporary failure occurs in network requests or API calls.  
Instead of retrying at fixed intervals, this approach exponentially increases the delay after each failure. This helps reduce server load and prevents excessive simultaneous retry attempts.

## How It Works and Why Itâ€™s Needed

### How It Works

1. Initial attempt: When a request fails, it does not immediately retry but instead waits for a specified delay.
2. Exponential growth: The delay after the first retry is short, but it doubles (e.g., 2x, 4x, 8x, etc.) after each failure.
3. Maximum limit: A maximum delay (`max delay`) is set to prevent excessive wait times.

For example, if the initial delay is set to 1 second, the retry intervals will follow this pattern: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, ....

### Why Is It Needed?

- Reduces server load: If all clients retry at the same time during network failures or temporary server issues, the server load can spike.
- Improves network stability: It provides time for transient issues to be resolved, increasing the likelihood of a successful retry.
- Prevents resource waste: By reducing unnecessary requests, it conserves network resources and server capacity.

## Combining Exponential Backoff with Jitter

Using only exponential backoff may still lead to clients retrying at the same time.  
To mitigate this issue, a technique called jitter is applied.

- Full Jitter: Picks a random value between `0` and the calculated delay.
- Equal Jitter: Adds a random value to half of the calculated delay to distribute requests more evenly.
- Decorrelated Jitter: Randomizes the next delay value independently of the previous delay.

By applying jitter, concurrent retry spikes can be further minimized, reducing server congestion.

## Code Example (TypeScript)

Below is a simple function implementing exponential backoff.  
It calculates the waiting time based on the retry count and limits it with a maximum delay.

```typescript
/
 * Function to calculate exponential backoff delay
 * @param attempt - Current retry count (starting from 0)
 * @param minDelay - Minimum delay (ms)
 * @param maxDelay - Maximum delay (ms)
 * @returns Computed delay (ms)
 */
function getExponentialBackoffDelay(
  attempt: number,
  minDelay: number = 1000,
  maxDelay: number = 32000
): number {
  // Compute exponentially increasing delay
  const delay = Math.min(minDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt), maxDelay);
  return delay;
}

// Example usage
async function makeRequestWithBackoff(requestFn: () => Promise<any>) {
  let attempt = 0;
  const maxAttempts = 5;

  while (attempt < maxAttempts) {
    try {
      const result = await requestFn();
      return result; // Return result on success
    } catch (error) {
      const delay = getExponentialBackoffDelay(attempt);
      console.warn(`Retry #${attempt + 1}: Retrying after ${delay}ms`);
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      attempt++;
    }
  }
  throw new Error("Max retry attempts exceeded");
}
```

This code applies exponential backoff when a network request or API call fails.  
You can further enhance it by adding jitter logic to introduce randomness.

## Conclusion

Exponential backoff is a highly effective retry strategy for distributed systems and network applications.

- It helps prevent server overload and improves network stability.
- When combined with jitter, it effectively resolves concurrent retry issues.

Implementing this strategy can enhance system resilience and improve user experience in cases of temporary failures.
