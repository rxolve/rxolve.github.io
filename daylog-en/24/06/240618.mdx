- If you're confused about calling an old routine, make a new interface (like a function) that you want to call, and use that instead.
- You can make this new interface just call the old one at first.
  - After you change all the old calls to use the new interface, you can remove the old one and make the new interface do the work directly.
- These new "bridge" interfaces are like small but important parts in your design.
- You might feel similar benefits when you:
  > Note: I asked the author, and this "similar feeling" means that after you make the change, future changes become easier.
  - Code backwards: Start with the last line of your routine. Write it like you already have everything you need.
  - Test-first coding: Write tests first to set what you need to do. (This is called TDD)
  - Helper design: If you had a routine, object, or service to do a specific job for you, the rest of the work becomes easier.

> I plan to try coding backwards tomorrow.
> I also plan to summarize this book backwards.
