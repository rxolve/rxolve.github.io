- Some parts of code keep growing.
  - Eventually, they become so complex that you need a magnifying glass to understand what they mean.
- If you've figured out a complicated part of code, try to take out a piece of it and give it a name (we call this a variable).
- Before:
  ```
  return new Point(
    ...long expression...,
    ...another long expression...
  )
  ```
- After:

  ```
  x = ...long expression...
  y = ...another long expression...
  return new Point(x, y)
  ```

- This way of tidying up puts the meaning you worked hard to understand back into the code.
- When you use these explanatory variables, they're separate from the complicated expressions.
  - Next time you need to change the code, you can find what you need quickly.
- As always, keep your tidying changes separate from changes that affect how the code works.
