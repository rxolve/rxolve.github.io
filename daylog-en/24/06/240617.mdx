- Yesterday, our server went down because the RDS CPU was maxed out.
- I thought it would be great if we could know about these situations in advance.
- So, I set up AWS CloudWatch alerts and Slack notifications.

#### Setting up Slack notifications in SNS

1. I made an endpoint on our API server to send messages to Slack.
   - Here's a simple version of the code:

```typescript
async createRdsCpuHighAlert(req: Request) {
    // Check the SNS message type
    const messageType = req.headers['x-amz-sns-message-type'];

    if (messageType === 'SubscriptionConfirmation') {
      // Get the subscription confirmation URL
      const subscribeUrl = req.body['SubscribeURL'];

      // Send a GET request to confirm the subscription
      axios
        .get(subscribeUrl)
        .then((response) => {
          // ...log subscription confirmation
          return 'OK';
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          // ...handle errors
        });
    } else if (messageType === 'Notification') {
      // Receive the message
      const message = JSON.parse(req.body['Message']);
      // ...send message to Slack
    }
    return 'OK';
}
```

2. In SNS, choose Topics, then Create topic.
3. Choose Standard type, give it a name, and create the topic.
4. Click Create subscription.
5. Choose HTTPS as the protocol, and enter the API URL we made in step 1 as the endpoint.
6. Expand Delivery policy (HTTP/S) - Optional and uncheck Use default delivery policy.
7. Change Content-Type from text/plain to application/json.
   - This is important so NestJS can read the body.
   - NestJS's default body parser seems to miss text/plain.

#### Setting up CloudWatch Alerts

1. In CloudWatch, click Create Alarm.
2. Click Select metric.
3. Choose RDS, then pick the DB instance and metric you want to watch.
   - I chose the CPUUtilization metric.
4. Set Threshold type to Static and enter your conditions.
   - I put Greater/Equal > 80.
5. Set up the alarm state and notification. For In alarm, choose the SNS topic we made earlier.
6. Give your alarm a name and create it.

#### Checking Slack Messages

- I tested by lowering the alarm condition to 20, and the Slack alert came through fine.
- I'm not sure if getting these alerts is good or bad.
  - It's normal as our service grows, but it might mean we need to scale up RDS or optimize our queries.
- It looks like AWS SNS doesn't support payloads for HTTPS API calls, so I couldn't add authentication.
  - This is something we need to improve.
