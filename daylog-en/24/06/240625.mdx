title: "GIN Index Breaking After AWS RDS Scale-up"

- **Background**: Yesterday, we increased the size of our RDS (a type of database service). We changed from a 't' type instance to an 'r' type instance.

- **Problem**: We finished the work in the morning, but in the afternoon, we got reports that some search terms weren't working.

- **What We Saw**: Searching for 'programm' worked, but searching for 'programming' didn't work.

- **Cause**: We think that something called a GIN index (a tool that helps with searching) was damaged.

- **Solution**: We rebuilt the index.

  ```sql
  REINDEX INDEX your_gin_index_name;
  ```

- **Analysis**: When we change the type of instance, RDS creates a new instance and moves the database.

  - During this process, indexes can sometimes get damaged.
  - GIN indexes are complicated and can be affected by changes in memory and how fast the computer can read and write data.

- **What We Learned**: We now know that after we increase the size of RDS, we need to test GIN indexes to make sure they're still working correctly.
