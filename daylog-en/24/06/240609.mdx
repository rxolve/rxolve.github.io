- The merge sort code I made yesterday looked plain without highlighting.
- GPT teacher showed me how to use prism-react-renderer, but it still didn't work today.
- Luckily, I found a well-organized blog! [Applying react-syntax-highlighter to MDXComponent](https://velog.io/@songhaeunsong/Next.js-%EB%B8%94%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EC%97%90-react-syntax-highlighter%EC%A0%81%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0)
- Here's how I applied it:

1. Install the libraries:

```bash
npm i react-syntax-highlighter
npm i -D @types/react-syntax-highlighter
```

2. Create a CodeBlock component in the components folder.
3. In the lib folder, make a component object using CodeBlock to pass to MDXRemote.
4. Add a components property to MDXRemote and pass the object we just made.

- Yesterday's merge sort code looks prettier now. I gave the first heart to Song Haeun's post. ü§ç
