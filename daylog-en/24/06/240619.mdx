- I was working on an API for notifications, but it was annoying to build and deploy to a dev server just for testing.
- I decided to try ngrok, which I had only heard of before.

1. Install ngrok:

```
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok
```

2. Sign up and add your token:

```
ngrok config add-authtoken {your_token}
```

3. Make your local server public:

```
ngrok http 3000
```

- In a flash, I got a URL that anyone can access from outside. It even supports HTTPS!
- I was curious about how it works, so I asked GPT:

  - ngrok is a tunneling program that lets people access your local server from outside.
  - The ngrok client sets up a TCP connection between the ngrok server and your local server.
    - This connection gets a unique subdomain that the ngrok server can show to the internet.
  - When someone from outside tries to access the URL ngrok gave you, the traffic goes to the ngrok server.
  - The ngrok server then sends this traffic through the tunnel to your local server.

  ```scss
  [Outside User] --(Internet)--> [ngrok Server] --(Tunnel)--> [ngrok Client] --(Local Network)--> [Local Server]
  ```

  - When your local server responds, the ngrok client sends this response back to the ngrok server.

- In short, ngrok acts like a bridge, using a technique called tunneling to let your local server talk to people on the internet.
- I think these cool tools are making the world easier for developers.
- Now I don't have to go through the hassle of building and deploying to an external server just for testing.
