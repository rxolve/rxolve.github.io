> [How to deploy a Nextjs app to GitHub pages?](https://medium.com/frontendweb/how-to-deploy-a-nextjs-app-to-github-pages-1de4f6ed762e)

0.  Continuing from yesterday, I worked on changing this site from [https://rxolve-github-io.vercel.app](https://rxolve-github-io.vercel.app) to [https://rxolve.github.io](https://rxolve.github.io).
    - First, I undid yesterday's work.
1.  In the repository's Settings - Pages - Source, I changed it to Github Actions.
2.  I clicked the configure button to create a basic workflow file.
3.  When I pushed to start the build, an error occurred in the Setup Pages step. It seems MDX wasn't building properly.
    > [Mdx does not build properly with GitHub Pages (Actions) #58637](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/58637)
    >
    > I removed it from the workflow.
4.  Like yesterday, I added these settings to next.config.js:

    ```javascript
    output: 'export',
    images: {
      unoptimized: true,
    },
    ```

    - I added "type": "module" to package.json and changed the filename back from next.config.mjs to next.config.js.
    - If you can't find the path to static files (like I couldn't yesterday), add assetPrefix in the production environment:
      ```javascript
      assetPrefix:
      process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/[repository-name]' : '',
      ```

5.  Pushing to the main branch starts the build. After deployment, I could see the homepage working properly.
    - Mr. Pico is back! ðŸŽ‰
    - [https://rxolve-github-io.vercel.app](https://rxolve-github-io.vercel.app) was automatically deactivated.
    - It seems simple now, but I made 14 commits during this process. ðŸ˜… I trusted GPT-4o teacher too much.
