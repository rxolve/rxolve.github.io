- I thought my site was ready to show others, so I registered it with Google Search Console.

1. Go to Google Search Console
   - [https://search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Add your property
   - After logging in, click "Add Property" on the dashboard.
   - Enter your website's URL in the URL prefix.
3. Prove ownership
   - Download the HTML file Google gives you.
   - Upload this file to the 'public' folder in your Next.js project.
   - After deploying, go back to Google Search Console and click "Verify".
4. Submit your sitemap

   > [sitemap.xml](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap)
   >
   > - The guide on the official site wasn't great for static sites.
   > - The auto-generated sitemap.xml couldn't find the generateStaticParams function.
   >   ```bash
   >   Uncaught Error: Page "/sitemap.xml/[[...__metadata_id__]]/route" is missing exported function "generateStaticParams()", which is required with "output: export" config.
   >   ```

   - So, I used the next-sitemap library instead.
     ```bash
     npm install next-sitemap
     ```
   - Create a file named next-sitemap.config.cjs in your project's root and set it up like this:
     ```js
     module.exports = {
       siteUrl: "https://rxolve.github.io", // Your site's main URL
       generateRobotsTxt: true, // Should we make a robots.txt file?
       outDir: "./out", // Where to put the exported files
       sitemapSize: 7000,
       changefreq: "daily",
       priority: 0.7,
       generateIndexSitemap: false, // Turn this off to index in Google Search Console
     };
     ```
   - Add these scripts to your package.json file:
     ```json
     "sitemap": "next-sitemap --config next-sitemap.config.cjs",
     "postbuild": "npm run sitemap",
     ```
     - This runs the next-sitemap command after next build to make your sitemap.
     - For static sites, set outDir to put the sitemap in the right folder.
   - Add this to your github workflow:
     ```yml
     - name: Postbuild - Generate sitemap
       run: npm run postbuild
     ```
   - After deploying, check if you can see your sitemap, then submit it in Google Search Console.

5. Wait
   - After submitting your sitemap, check its indexing status in Google Search Console.
   - When indexing is done, your site will show up in search results.

- I did the same thing with Naver Webmaster Tools.

  - [https://webmastertool.naver.com](https://webmastertool.naver.com)
  - It was easy because I had already set things up.

- Now all that's left is to write posts that help other people.
