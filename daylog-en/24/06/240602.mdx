> [The End of Programming](https://yozm.wishket.com/magazine/detail/1873/)

- This is a translated post written by Matt Welsh, originally posted on January 1st last year.
- One year later, Jensen Huang of NVIDIA declared that everyone in the world is now a programmer.
- Even today, with the combination of Next.js and Supabase, one person can build a service that can handle hundreds of thousands of users.
- In the future, won't we view today's programming like we view assembly language now? It feels like that era is not far off.
- For developers, the ability to apply the complex and abstract problems of the real world to the software domain will become more important.
- Therefore, the ability to quickly leverage rapidly evolving tools and strong communication skills will become increasingly crucial.
- A good developer will always be valued as a good developer, even in the future.
