> [The End of Programming](https://yozm.wishket.com/magazine/detail/1873/)

- This is a translation of an article written by Matt Welsh on January 1st last year.
- A year later, Jensen Huang from NVIDIA said that everyone in the world has become a programmer.
- Even now, one person can make a service that can handle hundreds of thousands of users using Next.js and Supabase.
- In the future, might we think of today's programming like we think of assembly language now? I feel that time is not far away.
- For developers, it might become more important to be good at applying complex, abstract real-world problems to software.
- So, I think the ability to use quickly developing tools and communicate well will become more important.
- People who are considered good developers now will probably still be good developers in the future.
