- I'm connecting to a payment API called [PayApp](https://payapp.kr/dev_center/dev_center01.html) to test recurring payments.
- The API endpoint is HTML and the example code is in PHP. This made me feel it was unusual.
- The response is also given as a string, not JSON. We need to parse it carefully to use it.

```typescript
// The endpoint is HTML, so we need to send data as form data.
const form = new FormData();
form.append("cmd", "rebillRegist");
// ...add more data to send
const payappRes = await axios.post(`{PayApp API HOST}`, form);

// Parse the PayApp response
const payAppResponse = new PayAppResponse();
payappRes.data.split("&").forEach((slice: string) => {
  const [key, value] = slice.split("=");
  payAppResponse[key] = value;
});

if (payAppResponse.state !== "1") {
  //...handle failure
}

// ...handle success
```

- It feels like making friends with someone who is older and tougher.
