0. I changed this site from [https://rxolve-github-io.vercel.app](https://rxolve-github-io.vercel.app) to [https://rxolve.github.io](https://rxolve.github.io).
1. Add these settings to next.config.mjs:

```javascript
   output: 'export',
   images: {
      unoptimized: true,
   },
```

2. Run `npm run build`. This creates files in the 'out' folder. Add the 'out' folder to `.gitignore`.
3. Install gh-pages:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

4. Add these scripts to package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
 "build": "next build",
 "predeploy": "npm run build",
 "deploy": "gh-pages -d out",
}
```

5. Run `npm run deploy`.
6. In the GitHub `your.github.io` project, go to Settings > Pages and change the Source to the gh-pages branch.
7. You can see the deployed page at `https://your.github.io`. But Pico CSS isn't working, so it looks bad. I'm sad about this.
   - The problem is that files in the `_next/static` folder are giving 404 errors.
   - I'll try to fix this tomorrow. Come back, Mr. Pico.
