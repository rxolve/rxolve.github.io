- A guard clause is a way to check certain conditions at the start of a function, and if those conditions aren't met, the function ends right away.
- Before - Nested if statements

```typescript
function processOrder(order: Order | null) {
  if (order !== null) {
    if (order.isValid) {
      if (!order.isProcessed) {
        // Order processing logic
        order.process();
      } else {
        console.log("Order is already processed.");
      }
    } else {
      console.log("Order is not valid.");
    }
  } else {
    console.log("Order is null.");
  }
}
```

- After - Using guard clauses

```typescript
function processOrder(order: Order | null) {
  if (order === null) {
    console.log("Order is null.");
    return;
  }
  if (!order.isValid) {
    console.log("Order is not valid.");
    return;
  }
  if (order.isProcessed) {
    console.log("Order is already processed.");
    return;
  }
  // Order processing logic
  order.process();
}
```

- It's like saying "Here are some things we need to check before we look at the details of the code."
  - The code is easier to read.
  - The function is less complicated.
  - It's easier to add new conditions.
- When you find a condition that fits perfectly, try using a guard clause to tidy up your code.
  - But don't overuse guard clauses. Be careful when splitting complex code into different cases.
- You should **always** tidy up your code in small steps.
