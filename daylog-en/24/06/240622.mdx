- It feels uncomfortable when you realize you need to change code that's spread out in different places.
  - What should you do when this happens?
- You can change the order of the code to put the parts you need to change close together.

  - If two routines are connected, put them next to each other.
  - If two files are connected, put them in the same folder.
  - If parts of code are connected, put them in the same code repository before making changes.

- Why don't we just remove the connections between parts of the code?

  > Cost of removing connections + How often things change < Cost of keeping connections + Cost of making changes

- But it can be hard to remove connections for different reasons:
  - If you don't know how to do it right now
  - If you don't have enough time right now
  - If your team is already making a lot of changes
    - Sometimes the team might already be stressed
    - (I understand this feeling)
- Don't leave your code spread out like it has holes and only focus on changing how it works.
  - If you organize your code to be more connected, it will be easier to change.
  - When you make the code a little more connected and clearer, you might suddenly see how to remove connections you couldn't before.
  - When parts of the code become more connected, the connections between different parts often get better too.
