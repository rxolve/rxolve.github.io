- While visiting my parents' home, I noticed a book I bought when I joined Samsung Electronics.
  - It's called 'Making It Big in Software' in English, but the Korean title translates to 'How to Live as a Programmer'.
- I want to share some sentences from the book:
  > - It defines a programmer's success by their contribution to the industry and impact on society, not by their bank balance.
  > - The purpose of technology is to reduce people's work and effort, bring freedom, and advance our exploration and understanding of the universe. No one has a bigger impact on making technology than the people who create it.
  > - Tech experts can have more "aha!" moments per hour than average people. They have ideas that create future technologies and shape the tech landscape. That's why so many companies treasure them.
  > - A successful career depends more on what you did than how much you worked.
- This makes me think about all the years I've lived as a programmer.
- I want to face "aha!" moments every day. I want to reduce people's efforts and improve our understanding of the universe.
- I want to create new tech landscapes. I believe I'm moving forward one step each day.
