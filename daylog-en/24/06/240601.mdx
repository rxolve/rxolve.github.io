- On January 1st of this year, I planned to launch a website I hastily put together in one day, but decided to refine it gradually. Five months have passed, and I've learned about the gap between planning and execution for ENTPs.
- While studying Next.js, I switched to Gatsby but eventually returned to Next.js. Working on this in my spare time as a break from my backend development job has been enjoyable.
- I would like to thank Pico CSS and GPT-4o for their help with design and coding.
- The initial code written by GPT was not for the latest version, but after pointing out the relevant parts, it started generating better functioning code.
- The era of humans coding is coming to an end.
