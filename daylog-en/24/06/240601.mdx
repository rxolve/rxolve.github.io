- On January 1st this year, I made a website in just one day. I planned to open it right away but decided to improve it bit by bit. Now, five months have passed. I learned about the gap between an ENTP's plans and actually doing things.
- I started learning Next.js, then switched to Gatsby, but came back to Next.js again. It was fun to work on this project in my free time while doing backend development at my job.
- I want to thank Pico CSS and GPT-4o. They helped me with the design and coding.
- The first code GPT gave me wasn't the newest version. When I pointed this out, it started making better code that worked well.
- The time when humans do coding might not last much longer.
