- Sometimes, when we create a variable and give it a value, these two steps are far apart in the code.
  - Usually, we can guess what a variable does from its name, but seeing its initial value makes this even clearer.
  - So, when these two steps are far apart, it's harder to understand the code.
- Here's an example of code like this:

```
fn()
  int a
  ...code that doesn't use a
  a=...
  int b
  ...code that can use a but doesn't use b
  b=...a
  ...code that uses b
```

- We can fix this by moving the value-giving step closer to where we create the variable:

```
fn()
  int a=...
  ...code that doesn't use a
  ...code that uses a but doesn't use b
  int b=...a...
  ...code that uses b
```

- Try moving things around like it's a game.

  - Pretend you're a mystery writer. Imagine how someone reading your code will feel.
  - Leave clues so people can tell who wrote this code.

- You'll probably make mistakes sometimes.

  - You might accidentally change how the code works when you're just trying to make it neater.
  - But that's okay. You can always go back to the correct version of the code.

- Work in small steps.
  - That's the best way to tidy up code.
  - Big changes in how things are designed can be hard and scary. Try to make smaller steps.
  - If it's still scary, make even smaller steps.
  - **The best size for a step is one that doesn't make you feel afraid.**
