- Just delete it. That's all. If code isn't being used, just remove it.
- Sometimes it's not easy to find unused code.
- You might ask, "What if I delete it and need it later?" Don't worry, version control tools can help with this.
- If you have:
  > - A lot of code that
  > - You're not using right now but
  > - You want to use in the future
  > - In exactly the same way it was written
  > - And it still works
  - Yes, you can bring it back. Or it might be better to write it again.
  - Even in the worst case, you can always undo your changes.
- As always, delete only a 'little' code in each cleaning step. This way, it's easier to fix if something goes wrong.
- How much is a 'little' is up to you. You could shorten a condition to 'true', or remove one routine, one file, or one directory at a time.

> I thought I should delete unused, ancient records in this project too.
