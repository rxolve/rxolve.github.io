- Kent Beck is the person who introduced ideas like patterns, TDD, and XP to the world. He's also a signer of the Agile Manifesto.
- This top developer in the world has released a new book. The title is "Tidy First?". It's the first book in a trilogy. The second book will be published next year.
- While reading the author's note, I found some great sentences:

> - I enjoy the moment when I wonder, 'What design could reduce this big change to a bite-sized piece?'
> - Programming sometimes feels like self-harm.
> - It seems we have a subconscious heroic mindset of piling up complexity and then trying to solve it impressively.
> - But is there any reason to avoid making work easier for yourself and others when you can?

- A developer is someone who breaks down difficult problems into small, manageable pieces before solving them.
- This reminded me of the merge sort algorithm, which uses the divide-and-conquer technique and recursion.
