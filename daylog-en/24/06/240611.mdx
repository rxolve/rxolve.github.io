- I decided to make product categories with 5 levels. I thought hard about the best way to design this.

- Each level of the category ID has 2 letters, so the whole ID is 10 letters long. Here's an example I came up with:

> - First level: 10 ('Programming')
> - Second level: 1001 ('Backend Development')
> - Third level: 100102 ('NestJS')
> - Fourth level: 10010207 ('Decorators')
> - Fifth level: 1001020704 ('Method Decorators')

- This way, I made sure lower levels include the higher levels.
- I realized we can easily find subcategories by matching the start of the ID.

```typescript
private findNextDepth = (
    allCategories: CategoryEntity[],
    items: Category[],
    ): Category[] => {
    // I look for lower levels using a method called recursion
    for (const item of items) {
        const nextDepth = allCategories.filter(
            (category) =>
                category.id.startsWith(item.id) &&
                category.id.length === item.id.length + CATEGORY_ID_DEPTH_UNIT,
        );
        if (nextDepth.length > 0) {
            const nextItems = nextDepth.map((category) =>
                Category.createByEntity(category),
            );
            item.items = this.findNextDepth(allCategories, nextItems);
        }
    }

    return items;
};
```

- The frontend developers suggested this idea to me yesterday.
- At first, I was going to do it the usual way. But when I started designing today, I realized this method was the best.
- I learned that if I listen, good ideas are often close by. I'm lucky to work with such smart developers.
