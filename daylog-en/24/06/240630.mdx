- I went on a trip over the weekend. I couldn't post yesterday and just now opened my MacBook.
- The empty space in my contribution graph looked lonely, so I'm writing about how to change commit dates using git rebase.

1. Make the commit you want to change
   - I committed a post I had written earlier.
     - [240629: Tidy First? 9. Explanatory Constants](../tag/TidyFirst/240629)
2. Start the rebase
   - Since I want to change the most recent commit, I use HEAD~1.
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~1
   ```
   - Here, -i means interactive mode. A text editor will open showing the list of commits to rebase.
3. Edit the commit
   - Type 'edit' in front of the commit you want to change, then save and close the editor.
     - In vi, use 'x' to delete, 'i' to enter insert mode, type 'edit', then ':wq' to save.
   - Before:
     ```bash
        pick <commit hash> <commit message>
     ```
   - After:
     ```bash
        edit <commit hash> <commit message>
     ```
4. Change the commit date
   - Now the rebase pauses and moves to the commit you want to change.
   ```bash
   GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="2024-06-29T12:00:00" git commit --amend --no-edit --date "2024-06-29T12:00:00"
   ```
5. Continue the rebase
   - After making changes, continue the rebase.
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```
   - If there's a conflict, fix it, use 'git add file' to stage the changes, then run 'git rebase --continue' again.
6. Push the changes
   - Push the changed commit to the remote repository. If it fails, use the --force option.
   ```bash
    git push --force
   ```
7. Check the changes
   - This process allowed me to change the commit date.
   - From now on, I plan to bring my MacBook when I travel.
