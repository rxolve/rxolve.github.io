- Yesterday, I was asked a fundamental question.
  > - Why do we lift heavy things?
- I remembered something I read in a book once. It might have been from "Beyond Order."
  > - Responsibility gives life meaning.
  > - Lift heavy weights.
  > - We are fragile, we die easily, and if we do nothing, we become useless.
  > - We must bear something on our backs.
  > - If you don't find something worth dedicating your life to, you'll remain a child.
  > - When the sense of noble responsibility is gone, all that remains is impulsive and base pleasures.
  > - Those who decide to bear heavy burdens do so.
  > - Those who have no burden to bear will tear themselves apart.
  > - Those who only chase after rights are useless.
  > - The meaning of life lies in responsibility.
- I thought about sharing this today morning but held back. That person will lift heavy weights. They have the strength to do so.
