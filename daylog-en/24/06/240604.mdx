- Yesterday, I was asked a deep question:
  > - Why do we lift heavy things?
- I remembered something I wrote down while reading a book. It was probably from "Beyond Order":
  > - Responsibility gives meaning to life.
  > - Lift heavy weights.
  > - We're easily hurt, easily killed, and useless if we do nothing.
  > - We must carry something on our backs.
  > - If you don't find something worth giving your life to, you stay a child.
  > - When noble responsibility disappears, only impulsive and low pleasures remain.
  > - People who decide to carry heavy burdens do so.
  > - People without burdens bite themselves.
  > - Those who only chase rights are useless.
  > - The meaning of life is in responsibility.
- I thought about saying this today morning but didn't. She will lift heavy enough weights. She have the strength to do so.
