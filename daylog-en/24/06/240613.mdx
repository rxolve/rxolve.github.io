- Code grows like a living thing. We can't write all the needed code at once.
  - So, the same problem gets solved differently depending on the time and person.
  - This is natural, but it can make code hard to read.
- Choose one way to do things and stick to it.
  - Fix code written in other ways to match your chosen way.
  - Clean up code that's different from your chosen way, one piece at a time.
- If there's a different part mixed in with similar parts, separate it.
