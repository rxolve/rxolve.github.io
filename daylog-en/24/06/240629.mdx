- Sometimes when reading code, we see numbers or words that we don't understand.
- **Create symbolic constants. Replace literal constants with these symbolic constants.**
  - We've heard this advice since we started programming, but some people still think it's not a big deal.
- Before:
  ```
  if response.code == 404
    ...code...
  ```
- After:

  ```
  PAGE_NOT_FOUND = 404
  if response.code == PAGE_NOT_FOUND
    ...code...
  ```

- Be careful in these cases:
  - When the same literal constant appears in two places, check if it's used with different meanings.
- First, read and understand the code.
  - If you put what you understand back into the code, you won't have to remember it the hard way.
- There are a few things that follow this code tidying method:
  - Put constants that need to change together or be understood together in one place.
  - Separate variables that are grouped for different reasons.
  - You'll learn about these things as you go. For now, just start working.
