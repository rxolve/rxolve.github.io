Last time, we created a game board by drawing a grid.

Now, it's time to create the snake.

#### The Idea

We'll store the snake's position in an array and use this array to change the color of the cells.

```typescript
{Array.from({ length: GRID_SIZE * GRID_SIZE }).map((_, index) => {
  const x = index % GRID_SIZE;
  const y = Math.floor(index / GRID_SIZE);
  const isSnake = snake.some((pos) => pos[0] === x && pos[1] === y);

  return (
    <div
      key={index}
      style={{
        width: `${CELL_SIZE}px`,
        height: `${CELL_SIZE}px`,
        backgroundColor: isSnake ? "blue" : "white",
      }}
    />
  );
})}
```

We use the modulo operator (%) to find the x-coordinate because it's an efficient and simple way to represent a 2D grid as a 1D array.

For the y-coordinate, we use division (/) for the same reason.

Here's how a 5x5 2D grid maps to a 1D array:

```
0  1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8  9
10 11 12 13 14
15 16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24
```

- For index 7: x = 7 % 5 = 2, y = 7 / 5 = 1
- For index 13: x = 13 % 5 = 3, y = 13 / 5 = 2
- For index 20: x = 20 % 5 = 0, y = 20 / 5 = 4

The quotient becomes the y-coordinate, and the remainder becomes the x-coordinate.

#### Managing Snake State

Let's define the `snake` state and its type:

```typescript
type Position = [number, number];

const INITIAL_SNAKE: Position[] = [
  [2, 2],
  [2, 3],
];

const Snake: React.FC = () => {
  const [snake, setSnake] = useState<Position[]>(INITIAL_SNAKE);
  // ...
};
```

The Position type is an array representing x and y coordinates.

We use the useState hook to manage the `snake` state.

This will show two stationary dots on the grid.

Yes, that's our star of the show - the snake.

In the next post, we'll bring this snake to life by making it move.
