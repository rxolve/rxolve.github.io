## What is Domain-Driven Design (DDD)?

For a long time, when making backend apps with Node.js, many coders worry about how to keep their code easy to fix and grow.

Then NestJS came out, and it became easy to use Domain-Driven Design.

DDD is a way to make software that focuses on the business area the software is trying to help with.

In other words, it's a method where coders and business experts work together to define business problems and make software to solve those problems.

## What is a Domain?

First, we need to understand what a domain is.

A domain is the **business area** that the software is trying to help with.

For example, if you're making an online store, "product management" or "order management" could be domains.

These can include smaller parts like product info, order info, shopping cart, payment, and more.

Domains can be split into three types:

- Core Domain

  - This is the most important part of the business.
  - For an online store, product management could be the core domain.

- Supporting Domain

  - These are features that help the core domain.
  - Stock management that supports product management could be an example.

- Generic Domain
  - These are features that are not unique to the business but are used in many businesses.
  - Login systems could be an example of this.

## Main Ideas in Domain-Driven Design

DDD includes these main ideas:

- Domain Model

  - A domain model is a software model that shows how the business domain is structured and works.
  - It's made up of:
    - Entities
    - Value Objects
    - Aggregates
    - Repositories

- Ubiquitous Language

  - This is a language defined so that coders and business experts can talk using the same words.
  - When all team members use the same terms, it can reduce misunderstandings.

- Bounded Context
  - This means the logical boundaries that separate domains.
  - Within each bounded context, the ubiquitous language and domain model are kept separate.
  - In an online store, product management and order management could be different bounded contexts.

## Using DDD in NestJS

To use DDD in NestJS, you can design your project like this:

This is similar to how you usually set up a project using NestJS's module system.

- Modules
  - Use NestJS's module system to show bounded contexts.
  - Each module matches a specific domain or sub-domain.
- Services
  - This is where you put the domain logic.
  - It handles the domain model and applies business rules.
- Entities and Value Objects
  - Entities represent things that can be identified, and value objects represent the properties of entities.
  - These are the main parts of the domain model.
- Repositories
  - These wrap the logic for accessing the database and act as a bridge between the domain model and data storage.
  - Define the queries you need in the repository and call them from the service to use them.

## Wrapping Up

When you design software based on a deep understanding of the domain, you can easily adapt to changes in business needs.

I plan to slowly study more about DDD and try to use it better in real work.
