Recently, I added Mermaid to MDX to draw a tree. But after refreshing the page, I encountered a Hydration error.

```
Text content did not match. Server: "" Client: "
    graph TD
      A[10] --> B[4]
      A --> C[17]
      C --> D[11]
      C --> E[20]
  "
```

That infamous error that you might encounter at least once while developing with Next.js has finally found its way to me.

## What is a Hydration Error?

A Hydration error occurs when the HTML rendered on the server does not match the component tree rendered on the client.

## Why Hydration Errors Happen

Hydration is the process of connecting the HTML rendered on the server with JavaScript on the client.

If the content on the server doesn't match the content on the client, the error occurs.

## How to Prevent Hydration Errors

#### 1. Using `useEffect`

Place code that should only run on the client inside the `useEffect` hook.

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const Component = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Code that runs only on the client
    fetchData().then(setData);
  }, []);

  if (!data) return null;

  return <div>{data}</div>;
};
```

#### 2. Using Dynamic Imports

Dynamic imports can be used to prevent pre-rendering.

```tsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const ClientOnlyComponent = dynamic(() => import("./ClientOnlyComponent"), {
  ssr: false,
});
```

#### 3. Using `suppressHydrationWarning`

The `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute can be used to suppress hydration warnings.

This is useful in cases where the server and client values are expected to differ, like timestamps.

```tsx
<time datetime="2016-10-25" suppressHydrationWarning />
```

#### 4. Environment Variable Prefix

Since environment variables can differ between the server and client, use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix to clearly distinguish environment variables accessible on the client.

## Fixing the Issue with Dynamic Imports

I resolved the issue by using dynamic imports when adding Mermaid to the MDXRemote component.

```tsx
// lib/mdx-components.tsx
// import Mermaid from "@/app/ui/mermaid";
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
const Mermaid = dynamic(() => import("@/app/ui/mermaid"), { ssr: false });

export const mdxComponents = {
  // ... existing components,
  Mermaid,
};
```
