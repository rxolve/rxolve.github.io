If you've been developing in JavaScript, you might have used `Object.keys()` and `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` before.

I wondered what the difference between these two methods was.

First, let's look at the basic difference between these two methods with some code:

```javascript
const obj = {};
obj.a = 1;
obj.b = 2;

Object.defineProperty(obj, "c", {
  value: 3,
  enumerable: false,
});

const sym = Symbol("d");
obj[sym] = 4;

console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // ['a', 'b']
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)); // ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

- `Object.keys()` only returns properties that are enumerable.
- `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` returns all string-keyed properties, whether they are enumerable or not.
- Neither method returns symbol properties.

So, if you want to get all properties, including symbol properties, you can use a custom function like this:

```javascript
const getAllProperties = (obj) => {
  return [
    ...Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj),
    ...Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj),
  ];
};

console.log(getAllProperties(obj)); // ['a', 'b', 'c', Symbol(d)]
```

In general, `Object.keys()` is more efficient, but if you need to check non-enumerable properties, you might need `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()`.
