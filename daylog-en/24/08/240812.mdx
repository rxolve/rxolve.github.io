The Binary Search Tree (BST) we implemented last time is a simple data structure where nodes can have two child nodes, left and right.

In this structure, the value of the left child node is smaller than the value of the parent node, and the value of the right child node is greater than the parent node.

While a BST can perform binary search efficiently, the performance of operations like search, insert, and delete can degrade as the height of the tree increases in certain cases.

To solve this problem, the concept of a Balanced Binary Tree was introduced, and an important concept here is the Balance Factor.

### What is a Balance Factor?

The Balance Factor is a value that indicates the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of each node in the tree.

Through this, you can determine whether the node is balanced or unbalanced.

- **Balance Factor = Height of the Left Subtree - Height of the Right Subtree**

Based on this value, you can make the following judgments:

- If the `Balance Factor` is **-1, 0,** or **1**, the node is balanced.
- If the `Balance Factor` falls outside this range, the tree is unbalanced, and an action (like rotation) is needed to restore balance.

### Applying Balance Factor to a Tree

We will use the `TreeNode` class defined in `240802 Things You Need to Make a Tree` below.

```typescript
// ... omitted

// Function to calculate the height of a node
const height = (node: TreeNode | null): number => {
  if (!node) {
    return 0;
  }
  // Add 1 to the larger of the left or right subtree heights
  return Math.max(height(node.left), height(node.right)) + 1;
};

// Function to calculate the Balance Factor of a node
const getBalanceFactor = (node: TreeNode | null): number => {
  if (!node) {
    return 0;
  }

  return height(node.left) - height(node.right);
};

// Function to print the Balance Factor of each node in the tree
const printBalanceFactors = (root: TreeNode | null): void => {
  if (root) {
    printBalanceFactors(root.left);
    console.log(
      `Node Value: ${root.value}, Balance Factor: ${getBalanceFactor(root)}`
    );
    printBalanceFactors(root.right);
  }
};

// Creating an example tree and printing Balance Factors
let root: TreeNode | null = null;
root = insert(root, 10);
root = insert(root, 5);
root = insert(root, 15);
root = insert(root, 22);
root = insert(root, 24);

printBalanceFactors(root);
// Node Value: 5, Balance Factor: 0
// Node Value: 10, Balance Factor: -2
// Node Value: 15, Balance Factor: -2
// Node Value: 22, Balance Factor: -1
// Node Value: 24, Balance Factor: 0
```

### Output

<Mermaid
  chart={`
    graph TD
        A[10] --> B[5]
        A --> C[15]
        C --> D[22]
        D --> E[24]
`}
/>

When you run the above code, the `Balance Factor` for each node will be printed.

If the tree is balanced, all nodes will have a `Balance Factor` of either -1, 0, or 1.

This tree is unbalanced, as some nodes fall outside this range, indicating that additional balancing work is required.

### Conclusion

The Balance Factor is a crucial indicator for assessing the balance of a tree.

To maintain efficient operations of a tree, it is necessary to calculate the Balance Factor and perform balancing operations when needed.

These balancing techniques are central to algorithms like AVL trees and Red-Black trees.
