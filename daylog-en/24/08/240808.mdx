In TypeScript, when defining types, there are times when you need to modify or extend existing types.

Mapped Types are a feature that allows us to create new types based on existing ones.

This helps us apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to the type system.

## Basic of Mapped Types

The basic structure of a Mapped Type is as follows:

```typescript
type MappedType<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};
```

This structure iterates over all properties of the existing type `T` to create a new type.

Like `Array.prototype.map`, Mapped Types can be thought of as applying a function to each property.

## Example: Readonly and Partial

The built-in `Readonly` and `Partial` utility types in TypeScript are good examples of Mapped Types.

```typescript
type Readonly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};

type Partial<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]?: T[P];
};
```

These make all properties read-only or optional, respectively.

## Combining with Conditional Types

Mapped Types become more powerful when combined with Conditional Types.

Conditional Types have the form `T extends U ? X : Y`, which chooses the type `X` or `Y` based on whether `T` extends `U`.

```typescript
type ConditionalMapped<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends Function ? K : never;
}[keyof T];
```

This type extracts only the keys of properties in `T` that are functions.

## Example: Creating API Response Types

```typescript
type ApiResponse<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: {
    data: T[K];
    loading: boolean;
    error: Error | null;
  };
};

interface UserData {
  profile: { name: string; age: number };
  posts: { title: string; content: string }[];
}

type UserApiResponse = ApiResponse<UserData>;

// UserApiResponse expands to:
// {
//   profile: {
//     data: { name: string; age: number }
//     loading: boolean
//     error: Error | null
//   }
//   posts: {
//     data: { title: string; content: string }[]
//     loading: boolean
//     error: Error | null
//   }
// }
```

Using this pattern allows you to manage API response types consistently and flexibly.

## Performance Considerations

While Mapped Types are powerful, they can affect the performance of the TypeScript compiler when dealing with complex types.

This is especially true with deep nesting or when combined with complex Conditional Types.

```typescript
type DeepMapped<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends object ? DeepMapped<T[K]> : T[K];
};
```

Such recursive mappings can significantly increase compile times when applied to large objects.

## Conclusion

Mapped Types make the TypeScript type system more expressive and flexible.

They help reduce repetition, increase type safety, and clearly express complex type relationships.
