In this post, I'll discuss how to implement an efficient deep copy in JavaScript using Proxy.

This technique is useful in terms of performance optimization and memory efficiency.

## Proxy Object

First, let's briefly look at the Proxy object.

A Proxy is a feature introduced in ES6 that allows you to redefine the default behavior (like property access, assignment, iteration, etc.) of an object with user-defined operations.

The basic structure of a Proxy object is as follows:

```javascript
const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
```

Here:

- `target` is the original object you want to proxy.
- `handler` is an object that defines traps. Traps are methods that intercept and redefine various operations on the object.

For example, let's create a simple proxy that logs property access on an object.

```javascript
const target = { name: "rxolve", age: 39 };
const handler = {
  get: function (obj, prop) {
    console.log(`Accessing property: ${prop}`);
    return obj[prop];
  },
};

const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);

console.log(proxy.name);
// Logs: Accessing property: name
// Output: rxolve
```

In this example, the `get` trap is called whenever a property of the object is accessed, logging the name of the accessed property.

## Lazy Cloning with Proxy

Now, let's implement an efficient deep copy using Proxy.

This method leverages the concept of "lazy evaluation," where copying is delayed until the property is actually accessed.

```javascript
function lazyDeepClone(obj) {
  if (typeof obj !== "object" || obj === null) return obj;

  return new Proxy(obj, {
    get(target, prop) {
      if (typeof target[prop] === "object" && target[prop] !== null) {
        return lazyDeepClone(target[prop]);
      }
      return target[prop];
    },
    set(target, prop, value) {
      if (target[prop] !== value) {
        target[prop] = value;
      }
      return true;
    },
  });
}
```

The key ideas in this implementation are:

1. Copying is performed only when a property is accessed (`get` trap).
2. If the property is an object, a new proxy is recursively created for that object.
3. Primitive values are returned as is.
4. When setting a value, the original object is modified (`set` trap).

## Usage Example

Let's look at an example of using the `lazyDeepClone` function.

```javascript
const original = {
  name: "rxolve",
  age: 39,
  address: {
    city: "Seoul",
    country: "Korea",
  },
  hobbies: ["reading", "crossfit"],
};

const cloned = lazyDeepClone(original);

console.log(cloned.name); // rxolve
console.log(cloned.address.city); // Seoul

cloned.address.city = "Los Angeles";
console.log(original.address.city); // Seoul (original is unchanged)
console.log(cloned.address.city); // Los Angeles

cloned.hobbies.push("coding");
console.log(original.hobbies); // ["reading", "crossfit"] (original is unchanged)
console.log(cloned.hobbies); // ["reading", "crossfit", "coding"]
```

As shown in this example, changing properties of the cloned object does not affect the original object.

This is an efficient way to maintain the deep copy characteristic, where copying only occurs when needed.

## Considerations

While lazy deep copying with Proxy is powerful, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- **Reference Equality**: Since the original and cloned objects have different references, be careful when comparing them with the `===` operator.

- **Performance Trade-off**: Every property access goes through a proxy, so in cases of frequent access, performance might actually decrease.

- **Circular References**: This implementation does not handle circular references. You may need additional logic to manage this in real-world use.

## Conclusion

Lazy deep copying using Proxy is a very effective method when dealing with large objects.

By optimizing memory usage and only copying when necessary, you can improve overall performance.
