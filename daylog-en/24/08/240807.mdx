Sometimes when making queries, you need to sort column values in a specified order. (For example, search fields)

Here, we assume that the specified order is stored as an array in `orderList`.

## ORDER BY

Usually, when sorting in TypeORM, we use the `orderBy` method. This matches the `ORDER BY` part in SQL.

But to sort in a specified order, we need a different way.

```typescript
query.orderBy(`${colname} ASC`);
```

## Case

We can sort in order by using a CASE statement inside the ORDER BY method. But this makes the code long and complicated.

```typescript
query.orderBy(`CASE
   WHEN ${colname} = '${orderList[0]}' THEN 1
   WHEN ${colname} = '${orderList[1]}' THEN 2
   ...
   ELSE ${orderList.length + 1} END`);
```

## PostgreSQL: ARRAY_POSITION

In PostgreSQL, we can sort in the order of an array using the `ARRAY_POSITION` function.

```typescript
query.orderBy(`ARRAY_POSITION(ARRAY['${orderList.join("','")}'], ${colname})`);
```

This way is shorter and easier to read than using a CASE statement.

It's also more flexible, so you don't need to change the query when you want to change the sorting order.

## MySQL: FIELD

In MySQL, you can use the `FIELD` function to do the same thing as ARRAY_POSITION.

```typescript
query.orderBy(
  `FIELD(${colname}, ${orderList.map((item) => `'${item}'`).join(", ")})`
);
```

## Summary

In PostgreSQL, you can use `ARRAY_POSITION`, and in MySQL, you can use the `FIELD` function to sort in the order of a specified array.
