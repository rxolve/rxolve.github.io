In the world of computer science, we often hear the term "Turing complete".

But I was curious about what this concept means exactly, and why it's important.

I want to take this chance to look at the concept of Turing completeness and share what I've learned.

## What is Turing-completeness?

Turing completeness means that a programming language or abstract machine has the same computational power as a Turing machine.

In other words, a system that can compute everything that a Turing machine can compute is called Turing complete.

## Historical Background

As you might guess from the name, this concept was first introduced by Alan Turing in his 1936 paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem".

In this paper, Turing presented a formal definition of computability, which became the foundation of modern computer science.

## The Meaning of Turing Completeness

A Turing complete system has the following features:

- Infinite memory: It should be able to use an infinite amount of memory in theory. Real computers have physical limits, but we assume they can use infinite memory logically.

- Conditional branching: The program should be able to run different commands based on certain conditions. For example, if-else statements fall into this category.

- Repetition: It should be able to repeat commands until a certain condition is met. For example, while or for loops fall into this category.

## Turing Completeness in Modern Programming

Most modern programming languages are Turing complete. But there are some interesting exceptions.

- SQL: Pure SQL is not Turing complete, but extensions like PostgreSQL are Turing complete.
  ```sql
  WITH RECURSIVE fibonacci(n, a, b) AS (
      SELECT 1, 0, 1
      UNION ALL
      SELECT n + 1, b, a + b
      FROM fibonacci
      WHERE n < 5
  )
  SELECT b
  FROM fibonacci
  WHERE n = 5;
  ```
- HTML+CSS: Surprisingly, CSS3 and HTML5 are Turing complete when used together.
  - [https://codepen.io/vlearnweb/pen/jGyKBm](https://codepen.io/vlearnweb/pen/jGyKBm)
- TypeScript's type system: You can write programs using only the TS type system.

  ```ts
  type Fibonacci<T extends number> = T extends 0 | 1
    ? 1
    : T extends 2
    ? 1
    : [...Fibonacci<Subtract<T, 1>>, ...Fibonacci<Subtract<T, 2>>]["length"];

  type Result = Fibonacci<5>; // 5
  ```

## Wrapping Up

Turing completeness is a fundamental concept in computer science and is important for understanding the capabilities of modern programming languages and systems.

Knowing whether a system is Turing complete helps us understand its abilities and limits.
