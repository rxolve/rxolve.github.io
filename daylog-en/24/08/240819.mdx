As you work with TypeScript, you might occasionally encounter the `never` type.

Types are used to specify what a variable, constant, or function represents, so seeing `never` can be confusing. Thatâ€™s why today's topic is the `never` type.

The `never` type is a subtype of all types, but it cannot hold any value.

In other words, the `never` type is used to represent values or situations that never occur.

It's mainly used to catch logical errors in code or to indicate that a function will never return normally.

```typescript
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}
```

In the example above, the `throwError` function throws an exception, so the function never completes normally.

In this case, the return type of the function is specified as `never`.

## Complete Type Checking

The `never` type can be used in a `switch` statement to ensure that all possible cases are handled.

For example, it can guarantee that all possible values of a certain type are processed.

```typescript
type Shape = "circle" | "square";

function getArea(shape: Shape): number {
  switch (shape) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * 2; // Assume calculation for circle's area
    case "square":
      return 4; // Assume calculation for square's area
    default:
      const exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
      throw new Error(`Unhandled shape: ${exhaustiveCheck}`);
  }
}
```

In the code above, the `default` case should never be executed, and if the `Shape` type is extended in the future to include a new form, a type-checking error will occur at compile time.

This is a very useful pattern for maintaining code.

## Impossible Conditions in Union Types

The `never` type can be used to filter out impossible situations in conditional types.

For example, if a function must perform different actions based on the type it receives, you can use `never` to improve type safety.

```typescript
type Action = { type: "start" } | { type: "stop" };

function handleAction(action: Action) {
  if (action.type === "start") {
    // Start logic
  } else if (action.type === "stop") {
    // Stop logic
  } else {
    // Recognize that this block should never be executed
    const _: never = action;
  }
}
```

Here, the `else` block is unreachable, which TypeScript recognizes as the `never` type.

This pattern ensures that your code handles all possible cases while allowing the union type to be extended.

## Enhancing Debugging and Code Stability

In complex type systems, you can use the `never` type to prevent unintended types from being passed to a function.

This pattern is especially useful in large codebases, as it helps prevent unexpected type errors in advance.

## Combining with Conditional Types

The `never` type can be combined with conditional types to create a more sophisticated type system.

For example, it can be used to restrict certain types from ever occurring in conditional types.

```typescript
type ExcludeNever<T> = T extends never ? never : T;
```

The `never` type is a subtype of all types, but it cannot hold any value.

So, when a union type includes `never`, that `never` is essentially meaningless.

For example, `string | never` is treated as just `string` because `never` cannot hold any value.

When a union type is reduced to `never` under certain conditions, or when `never` appears as part of a union type, you can use the `ExcludeNever` type to explicitly remove it.

It removes the `never` if the given type `T` is `never`, and otherwise, it keeps the original type.

## In Conclusion

The `never` type in TypeScript may seem like a simple basic type, but when used correctly, it can greatly improve the stability and readability of your code.

To truly master TypeScript, it's important to develop the habit of using the `never` type to prevent potential errors in your codebase before they occur.
