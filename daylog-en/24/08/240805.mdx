- Tidying code is like eating potato chips. When you eat one, you want to eat another right away.
  - So, managing the urge to keep tidying code is also a key skill in code tidying.
- The author suggests sticking to and trying out a way of tidying code in very small steps.
  - Optimize each step.
- Now code tidying becomes a kind of chess game, where you can see the next move.

#### Guard Clauses

- You get the benefit of helping to reveal explanatory helpers or extract explanatory variables.

#### Dead Code

- You'll see ways to arrange code in the order it's read and placements that increase cohesion.

#### Normalize Symmetries

- You can read very similar pieces of code in the order they're grouped.

#### New Interface, Old Implementation

- When you tidy one thing, it leads to a bunch of tidying, and then each of those leads to another bunch.
  - We'll look at this more when we talk about coupling and power laws.

#### Reading Order

- Opportunities to match symmetry may arise.

#### Cohesion Order

- Elements grouped together become candidates for extraction as sub-elements.

#### Explanatory Variables

- Thanks to the explanation you can know from variable names, you can delete unnecessary comments.

#### Explanatory Constants

- Leads to cohesion-increasing arrangements. If you group constants that change at once, it's good for changing later.

#### Explicit Parameters

- You can group parameter sets into objects and move code.

#### Chunk Statements

- You can attach explanatory comments in front of code chunks. You can also change them to explanatory helpers.

#### Extract Helper

- You can introduce guard clauses, extract explanatory constants or variables, and delete unnecessary comments.

#### One Pile

- You can expect methods like arranging similar code together, organizing explanatory comments, and extracting helpers.

#### Explanatory Comments

- If possible with the introduction of explanatory variables, constants, helpers, and such, move information in comments to code.

#### Delete Redundant Comments

- It helps improve reading order, and opportunities to use explicit parameters come up.

### Conclusion

- Be careful not to change too much, too quickly.
- Usually, succeeding with small tidying in sequence saves more time than failing with excessive tidying.

> This was a chapter summarizing Part 1. I feel regretful that I may have hastily summarized the book's excellent sentences. I recommend reading the original book.
