Among the skills of managing code tidying, managing the rhythm of tidying is also important.

In the previous chapter, we recommended keeping the scope of tidying small.

How much time does a series of structural changes take before implementing a specific behavior change?

Keep it in minutes, but it shouldn’t take more than an hour.

If a single tidy-up takes longer than an hour, it might mean that you missed the right time for the minimal structural changes needed for the desired behavior change.

Or, the code might be so messy that it could be better to spend a few hours tidying it up before making any behavior changes.

However, this can't be sustained for long. Software design is very much like **“paving the way.”**

Here’s a story:

At a university, several buildings were built, but they couldn't decide where to place the pathways.

Instead of guessing carefully, they planted grass in all the spaces between the buildings.

A few months later, paths emerged where the grass had been worn down by students walking.

The planners then smoothly paved these worn-down paths.

**Behavior changes tend to cluster together in the code.**

According to the Pareto principle, 80% of the changes happen in 20% of the files.

One of the key benefits of tidying first is that the tidying itself also tends to cluster together.

And after tidying, the code is in a perfect state for making precise behavior changes.

As you continue tidying, most of the changes will happen within already tidied code.

As a result, even though you haven't touched most of the code in the system, the chances of encountering untidied code drop significantly.

This is why I can confidently say that tidying should only take a few minutes to an hour.

Yes, sometimes it might take longer, but it won’t be that long.
