Before integration and deployment, what is the appropriate size for code tidying?

When the batch size of code tidying increases, the following costs occur.

---

#### Conflicts

The more code tidying is done in a batch, the longer the delay in integration, and the greater the chance that the tidying will conflict with someone else's ongoing work.

#### Interactions

Handling multiple code tidy-ups at once can accidentally lead to changes in behavior.

#### Guesswork

The more code tidying done at once, the more code gets cleaned, which can lead to unexpected additional costs.

---

Due to these factors, it's usually better to reduce the number of code tidy-ups per batch before integrating and deploying.

However, in many organizations, the fixed cost of reviewing and deploying a single change is quite high.

So, what should be done?

If you want to reduce the use of code tidying, increase the batch size of tidying to lower the cost associated with changes in behavior.

This will reduce the cost of reviews.

You and your team need to find ways to properly reduce review costs.

If there is trust and a strong culture within the team, there is no need to review after code tidying.

It takes at least a few months to reach a level of safety and trust where code tidy-ups no longer need reviews.

Practice, experiment, and review errors with your team.
