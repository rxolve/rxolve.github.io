How big should code clean-up be before we join and send it out?

When we do more code clean-up at once, these costs happen:

---

#### Clashes

The more code clean-up we do at once, the longer it takes to join, and the more likely our clean-up work will clash with other people's ongoing work.

#### Working Together

When we do many clean-ups at once, we might accidentally change how things work.

#### Guessing

The more clean-ups we do at once, the more code we naturally clean up. This leads to extra costs we didn't expect.

---

Because of these things, we usually do fewer clean-ups at once before joining and sending out.

But **in many groups, the fixed cost of checking and sending out one change is quite high.**

So what should we do?

If you want to lower the use of clean-ups, **do more clean-ups to lower the cost of changing how things work.**

This can lower the cost of checking.

You and your team need to find a good way to lower checking costs.

If your team has trust and a strong culture, you might not need to check after clean-ups.

It takes at least a few months to reach a level of safety and trust where you don't need to check clean-ups.

**Practice and try things out. Look at mistakes with your team.**
