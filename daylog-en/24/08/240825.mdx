I wanted to create a game like 2048.

But since I couldn't come up with a design, I decided to try making a simpler game: Snake.

There are many examples on Google, and GPT can quickly help implement it.

First, I created the game board using Tailwind.

```typescript
"use client";

import React from "react";

const GRID_SIZE = 20;
const CELL_SIZE = 20;
const GAP_SIZE = 1;

const Snake: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <main className="text-center">
      <h1>Snake Game</h1>
      <div
        className="grid bg-gray-300 border border-gray-400 mx-auto"
        style={{
          gridTemplateColumns: `repeat(${GRID_SIZE}, ${CELL_SIZE}px)`,
          gap: "1px",
          width: `${GRID_SIZE * (CELL_SIZE + GAP_SIZE)}px`,
        }}
      >
        {Array.from({ length: GRID_SIZE * GRID_SIZE }).map((_, index) => (
          <div
            key={index}
            className="bg-white"
            style={{
              width: `${CELL_SIZE}px`,
              height: `${CELL_SIZE}px`,
            }}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Snake;
```

This is simple code that draws a grid and creates an array corresponding to each cell.

The main points are as follows:

- **GRID_SIZE**:

  - Represents the number of rows and columns in the grid.
  - Here, we are creating a 20x20 grid.

- **CELL_SIZE**:

  - Represents the size of each cell.
  - Each cell is 20px by 20px.

- **GAP_SIZE**:

  - Represents the gap between each cell.
  - Here, there is a 1px gap.

- **gridTemplateColumns**:

  - Defines the columns of the grid.
  - Creates columns according to GRID_SIZE, and each column's width is set by CELL_SIZE.

- **Array.from**:
  - Creates an array of size `GRID_SIZE * GRID_SIZE` and then renders each cell using the map method.
  - Although the grid is 2D, it is rendered using a 1D array.

Next time, we'll create the main character of this game: the snake.
