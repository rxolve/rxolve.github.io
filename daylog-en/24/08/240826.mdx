Today, a team member asked if we could increase the Lambda timeout to 5 minutes.

This made me wonder about the cost.

I knew Lambda was cheap, but I wanted to know how the cost changes based on actual runtime.

## Lambda Pricing

> Source: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing

Here's the Lambda pricing from the AWS website for the Seoul region, x86 architecture, 1GB memory.

---

First 6B GB-sec/month | $0.0000166667 per GB-sec | $0.20 per 1M requests

---

## Time Pricing

$0.0000166667 per second means:

- $0.001 per minute
- $0.06 per hour
- $1.44 per day

For $1, you can run Lambda for about 16 hours and 40 minutes.

If you run a daily scheduler, that's about 33 minutes per day for a month.

Remember, Lambda has a maximum runtime of 15 minutes.

Even if you run a daily scheduler for the maximum time, you won't reach $1 per month.

## Request Pricing

$0.20 per million requests means you can make 5 million requests for $1.

That's about 166,666 requests per day for a month.

## Conclusion

Even if your company has always-on instances, Lambda's cost is very attractive.

You can handle high-load tasks without affecting your core infrastructure.

It's even better for small projects or services.

Use Lambda. Use it twice. It's still just $2 per month.
