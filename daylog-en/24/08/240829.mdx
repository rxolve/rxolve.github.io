I've been using npm for a long time, but at some point, npx showed up.

I've been using it without even realizing it, so I decided to figure out the differences and when to use each tool.

#### npm (Node Package Manager)

npm is the default package manager for Node.js, and it's a tool for **managing** packages.

It mainly does the following:

- Manages dependencies
- Installs packages (locally or globally)
- Manages versions
- Runs scripts

The main feature of npm is managing project dependencies through the `package.json` file.

This is important for ensuring consistency in your project.

Let’s briefly see what happens when npm installs a package.

1. Resolving dependencies: It analyzes the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
2. Downloading packages: It downloads the required packages from the npm registry.
3. Extracting and installing: It extracts and installs the downloaded packages into the `node_modules` directory.
4. Linking binaries: If needed, it creates symbolic links to executable files in the `node_modules/.bin/` directory.

#### npx (Node Package Execute)

npx is a tool that comes built-in with npm starting from version 5.2.0, and it’s used to **execute** npm packages.

It’s mainly used for:

- Running commands from locally installed packages
- Running one-off commands (without installing the package)
- Running scripts with a specific version of Node.js
- Directly running scripts from a GitHub gist or repository

Here’s how npx executes a command:

1. Command search: It first looks for the command in the local `node_modules/.bin/` directory.
2. Cache check: If not found, it checks the npx cache for the command.
3. Temporary installation: If still not found, it temporarily installs the package from the npm registry.
4. Execution and cleanup: It runs the command and removes the temporarily installed package.

npx is useful in CI/CD environments where you need to run tools without installing global packages.

```yaml
# Example in GitHub Actions
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Use Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v2
    with:
      node-version: "14"
  - run: npx prettier --check .
```

#### Version Management

- npm uses version ranges in `package.json`, but npx always uses the latest version.

```bash
# Install a specific version with npm
npm install cowsay@1.4.0

# Run the latest version with npx
npx cowsay "Hello"
```

#### Using Them Together

- You can simplify complex tasks by combining npm scripts with npx.

  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "npm run clean && npx webpack && npm run test"
      // ...
    }
  }
  ```

#### Summary

npm is used to manage project dependencies and provide a consistent development environment.

npx is useful for running one-time tasks or quickly executing tools with different versions.
