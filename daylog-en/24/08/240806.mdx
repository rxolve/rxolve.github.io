## Problem

Near the end of the workday, a error happened on our main service page.

## Cause

All API responses were normal, but the front-end couldn't get to the resources.

I felt it was a data issue and was looking for broken data.

Then, a front-end developer told me that the image URL was NULL.

## Fix

When I found and deleted the related data, things went back to normal. The service had errors for 30 minutes.

It seemed like a mistake or error happened when managers uploaded images through the admin tool.

I was going to add code in the API to handle cases where all image URLs are NULL. But my manager asked if I could just make the column NOT NULL.

I thought this could fix the issue right away without needing to deploy new code.

This would stop bad data from getting in without needing extra checks in the admin tool.

## What I Learned

I really felt how important it is to handle Nullability well.

It's easy to forget about handling Nullable fields. It's good to talk about this clearly with the front-end developers.

I was thankful that the planning team said they would think about this kind of thing early on.

I also learned that putting rules on the table can be better for fixing issues than writing a few lines of safety code.
