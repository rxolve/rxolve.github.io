## Why Did My Array Change?

In JavaScript, we might sometimes see a problem with shallow copy and deep copy. Let's learn about them!

## Shallow Copy: Simple but Risky

A shallow copy makes a new object, but it only copies the addresses of the things inside the original object.

This means if you change something deep inside the copy, it changes in the original too!

You can make a shallow copy using `Object.assign()` or the spread operator (`...`).

```javascript
const original = { name: "John", skills: ["JavaScript", "React"] };
const shallowCopy = { ...original };

shallowCopy.name = "Jane";
shallowCopy.skills.push("Node.js");

console.log(original); // { name: 'John', skills: ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node.js'] }
console.log(shallowCopy); // { name: 'Jane', skills: ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node.js'] }
```

See how the `skills` array changed in both? This can save memory, but it can also cause unexpected problems.

## Deep Copy: Safe but Costly

A deep copy makes a completely new object, copying everything inside, even other objects.

This way, changing the copy doesn't affect the original at all.

The easiest way to do this is with `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))`. But be careful, this method has some tricks.

```javascript
const original = {
  sayHi: () => console.log("Hello"),
  symbol: Symbol("foo"),
  nothing: undefined,
  today: new Date(),
};

const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));

console.log(deepCopy);
// { today: "2023-08-01T12:34:56.789Z" }
// sayHi, symbol, and nothing are all gone!
```

This method ignores functions, symbols, and undefined values, and changes dates to strings. This can cause surprises!

## Which is Faster?

If your program needs to be super fast, choosing the right copy method is important.

Usually, shallow copy is much faster. The difference can be bigger for larger and more complex objects.

## Structural Sharing: A Smart Way

Some smart programs use a method called structural sharing. It only makes new copies of the parts that change and keeps the rest the same.

```javascript
function updateNestedObject(obj, path, value) {
  if (path.length === 1) {
    return { ...obj, [path[0]]: value };
  }
  return {
    ...obj,
    [path[0]]: updateNestedObject(obj[path[0]], path.slice(1), value),
  };
}

const original = { a: { b: { c: 1, d: 2 }, e: 3 }, f: 4 };
const updated = updateNestedObject(original, ["a", "b", "c"], 5);

console.log(original.a.b.c); // 1
console.log(updated.a.b.c); // 5
console.log(original.a === updated.a); // false
console.log(original.a.b === updated.a.b); // false
console.log(original.f === updated.f); // true
```

This way, we get the safety of a deep copy and the speed of a shallow copy!

Here's what it looks like inside:

```json
original: {
  a: {
    b: { c: 1, d: 2 },
    e: 3
  },
  f: 4
}

updated: {
  a: {
    b: { c: 5, d: 2 },  // New object
    e: 3
  },
  f: 4
}
```

- `updated.a.b` is a new object.
- `updated.a` is also a new object.
- But `updated.f` and `updated.a.e` are the same as in `original`.

## Wrapping Up

Copying in JavaScript might look simple, but there's a lot to think about!

Sometimes a shallow copy is enough, sometimes you need a deep copy.

And if you need your program to be fast, you might want to use structural sharing.

Next time, we'll learn about using something called a proxy to make deep copies more efficiently.
