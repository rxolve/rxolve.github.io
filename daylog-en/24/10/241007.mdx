The author remembers hearing a shocking report during their early programming days: 70% of software development costs are spent on maintenance.

Seventy percent!

In the first study on coupling and cohesion, _Structured Design_, it was assumed that the goal of software design is to minimize the cost of software.

According to a concept the author calls "Constantine’s Equivalence," the cost of software is almost the same as the cost of changing it.

> Cost(software) ~= Cost(change)

If you graph the cumulative cost over the software lifecycle, it looks like a logarithmic curve.

The pre-release period takes up a small part of the total time and a small portion of the overall cost.

Then, one day, we apply a change that seems similar to previous ones, but this time, it blows up right in front of us.

Suddenly, the cost increases not just by one unit but by 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x. This happens because of friction with the existing system.

If you’re familiar with power law distributions, you’ll understand what's happening here.

A key feature of the power law is that a small number of large "outliers" have an outsized impact.

Together, they have a bigger effect than a large number of "normal" events. The five biggest storms cause more damage than 10,000 smaller ones.

In other words, the cost of change is almost equal to the cost of the big changes.

> Cost(total changes) ~= Cost(big changes)

Why are big changes so expensive? What causes changes to "spread"? It's coupling.

> Cost(big changes) ~= Coupling

Now we have the full Constantine’s equation.

> Cost(software) ~= Cost(total changes) ~= Cost(big changes) ~= Coupling

So, to reduce the cost of software, we need to reduce coupling.

But reducing coupling isn’t free, and trade-offs are unavoidable.
