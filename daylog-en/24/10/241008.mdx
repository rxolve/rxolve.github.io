The **isolation level** of a transaction is a setting that determines how much transactions should be kept separate from each other when running at the same time.

In a database, even when many transactions are running simultaneously, the system must maintain a consistent state. The isolation level is key to balancing **concurrency** (how many transactions can happen at once) and **performance**.

There are four levels of isolation, based on how much concurrency is allowed:

### **Read Uncommitted**

- **Description**: One transaction can read data that another transaction hasn't committed yet. This means that other transactions can see the intermediate state of an ongoing transaction.
- **Problem**: This can lead to **dirty reads**. If uncommitted data is rolled back later, transactions that read that data may have read incorrect information.
- **Advantage**: Since this is the lowest isolation level, it offers the best performance but sacrifices data consistency.
- **Concurrency issues allowed**: Dirty Read, Non-repeatable Read, Phantom Read

### **Read Committed**

- **Description**: A transaction can only read data that has been committed. Changes made during a transaction aren't visible to others until the transaction is committed.
- **Problem**: **Non-repeatable reads** can happen. After a transaction reads data, another transaction might change or delete that data, and the original transaction could get a different result if it reads the data again.
- **Advantage**: This is the default isolation level in most DBMS, offering a good balance between performance and consistency.
- **Concurrency issues allowed**: Non-repeatable Read, Phantom Read

### **Repeatable Read**

- **Description**: The same data will return the same result throughout the transaction. Other transactions cannot modify or delete this data until the first transaction finishes.
- **Problem**: **Phantom reads** can still occur. If a transaction reads a range of data, another transaction could insert new rows into that range, so a repeated read might return more results.
- **Advantage**: Ensures consistent reads within a transaction but may slightly impact performance.
- **Concurrency issues allowed**: Phantom Read

### **Serializable**

- **Description**: This is the highest isolation level, making transactions act as if they were executed one after the other. No other transaction can interfere, preventing any concurrency issues.
- **Problem**: Performance can drop significantly because of the locking needed to avoid conflicts. Some transactions may be rolled back due to **serialization failures**.
- **Advantage**: Guarantees perfect data consistency, but at a high cost in performance.
- **Concurrency issues allowed**: None

### Summary of Concurrency Issues at Each Isolation Level

| Isolation Level  | Dirty Read   | Non-repeatable Read | Phantom Read |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Read Uncommitted | Possible     | Possible            | Possible     |
| Read Committed   | Not Possible | Possible            | Possible     |
| Repeatable Read  | Not Possible | Not Possible        | Possible     |
| Serializable     | Not Possible | Not Possible        | Not Possible |

### Conclusion

- Lower isolation levels improve concurrency and performance but may cause data consistency problems.
- Higher isolation levels ensure better data consistency but can slow down concurrency and performance.
- If data consistency is critical, use a higher level like Serializable. However, in most systems, **Read Committed** or **Repeatable Read** is sufficient.

Choosing the right isolation level is key to finding the balance between performance and data consistency.
