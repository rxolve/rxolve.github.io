Controlling the snake with the keyboard every time can be quite exhausting.

Let's change the game into a relaxing experience where the snake automatically finds the food by itself, and you can just watch it play.

First, we remove the arrow key controls and create a function that calculates the next direction.

The function calculates the distance to the food using **Manhattan distance** for all possible directions and moves the snake towards the closest one.

```ts
const calculateNextDirection = useCallback((): Position | null => {
  const [headX, headY] = snake[0];
  const [foodX, foodY] = food;

  // Filter out directions that lead to a collision with walls or the snake’s body
  const validDirections = DIRECTIONS.filter(([dx, dy]) => {
    const newHead: Position = [headX + dx, headY + dy];
    return (
      !checkCollisionToWall(newHead) &&
      !checkCollisionToBody(newHead, snake.slice(1))
    );
  });

  // If there are no valid directions, the game ends
  if (validDirections.length === 0) return null;

  // Pick the direction with the shortest Manhattan distance to the food
  const bestDirection = validDirections.reduce((best, current) => {
    const [currentDx, currentDy] = current;
    const newHead: Position = [headX + currentDx, headY + currentDy];

    const bestDistance =
      Math.abs(best[0] + headX - foodX) + Math.abs(best[1] + headY - foodY);
    const currentDistance =
      Math.abs(newHead[0] - foodX) + Math.abs(newHead[1] - foodY);

    return currentDistance < bestDistance ? current : best;
  });

  return bestDirection;
}, [snake, food]);
```

The `moveSnake` function is updated like this:

Now, instead of reacting to arrow key inputs, it uses the `calculateNextDirection` function to decide the next move.

```ts
const moveSnake = useCallback(() => {
  if (gameOver) return;

  const newDirection = calculateNextDirection();
  if (!newDirection) {
    setGameOver(true); // End the game if no valid path is available
    return;
  }

  const newSnake = [...snake];
  const head = newSnake[0];
  const newHead: Position = [
    head[0] + newDirection[0],
    head[1] + newDirection[1],
  ];

  newSnake.unshift(newHead);

  if (newHead[0] === food[0] && newHead[1] === food[1]) {
    generateFood();
    setScore((prevScore) => prevScore + 1);
  } else {
    newSnake.pop();
  }

  setSnake(newSnake);
}, [snake, gameOver, calculateNextDirection, generateFood]);
```

We also remove the arrow key event listener since it’s no longer needed.

Finally, there are still some bugs to fix, such as situations where the snake traps itself.

If we improve the direction calculation algorithm further, the snake might eventually fill the entire screen!
