## Why Don’t We Remove All Coupling? Why Does It Even Exist?

Coupling in software can be compared to Lego pieces scattered on a dark floor—you don’t notice them until you step on one. But why do we need coupling at all?

### Why Does Coupling Exist?

One reason is that it made sense to have it during implementation. As mentioned in the previous chapter, at the time of coding, leaving the coupling in place was the most cost-effective decision. Profit first, cost later. Now, the "later" has arrived.

Another reason is that the coupling didn’t seem to cause problems before—so no one saw it as an issue.

Lastly, some types of coupling simply can't be avoided. Unfortunately, this isn’t something I can fully explain or prove—just a truth we have to accept.

In the end, the reason coupling exists doesn’t really matter. What matters is whether you’ll pay the cost of managing the existing coupling or pay the cost to remove it.

## Example: Communication Protocol

Let’s take a simple example to understand this:

```
Sender>>send()
    writeField1()
    writeField2()

Receiver>>receive()
    readField1()
    readField2()
```

There’s clear coupling between these two functions. If one changes, the other must also change.

After doing this repeatedly (say, 100 times), we’d probably want to create a standardized interface:

```
format = [
    {field: "1", type: "integer"},
    {field: "2", type: "string"}
]

Sender>>send()
    writeField(format)

Receiver>>receive()
    readField(format)
```

Boom! The coupling seems to have disappeared. Now, you only need to change the `format` in one place.

However, this doesn’t mean the coupling is truly gone.

## The Trade-Off of Coupling

What we’ve done is increase flexibility in how things are implemented. But here’s the tricky part: in my experience, reducing coupling for one type of change usually increases coupling for another.

This means you shouldn’t obsess over eliminating every instance of coupling. The goal is to find a balance—a sweet spot where you can live with some coupling while reaping the benefits of decoupling where it matters most.

## A Balancing Act

You’ll always need to decide:

- Pay the cost of managing coupling?
- Or pay the cost of removing it?

Designing software is hard because of these trade-offs. And relationships between people? That’s something we’ll cover in the next book of the series.
