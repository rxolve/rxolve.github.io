The speed of your writing depends on how you construct your sentences.

> The input data is a three-dimensional vector because it uses each color’s RGB value.

In this sentence, the subject is "the input data." So, it can be moved to the beginning of the sentence.

> The input data is a three-dimensional vector because it uses each color's RGB value.

This sentence shows a cause-and-effect relationship, so it can be split into two simpler sentences.

> The input data uses each color’s RGB value. Therefore, the input data is a three-dimensional vector.

Write what you know directly.

> The input data is a three-dimensional vector.

Now, explain why the input data is a three-dimensional vector.

For readers who are not familiar with graphics programs, you might add extra explanation.

> The input data is a three-dimensional vector because it uses each color’s RGB value.

By stating the main point simply and adding extra details if needed, you can make sentences easier to write.

At this point, you could use the subject of the first sentence as a subheading to naturally structure each paragraph.
