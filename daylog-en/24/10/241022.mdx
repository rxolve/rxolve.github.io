Code reviews help improve the quality of a team's code and give developers a chance to learn from each other.

However, if the reviewer approaches the review inefficiently, whether by accident or on purpose, it can waste the developer's time and lower their motivation.

Here are some interesting code review anti-patterns mentioned in the post above:

---

#### The Death of a Thousand Round Trips

This happens when the reviewer finds a small issue, gives feedback, and stops. The developer fixes the issue and resubmits the code.

Then, the reviewer points out another minor issue, and the process repeats. Eventually, the developer becomes tired of constantly waiting for reviews.

> It's better to read the code thoroughly in one go and give as much feedback as possible from the start.
>
> It's also important to give feedback quickly, especially if the team members are in different time zones.

---

#### The Ransom Note

In this pattern, the reviewer notices a patch that is very important to the developer. The reviewer uses this as an opportunity to demand extra tasks.

They might say, "You need to add this before I can approve," even if the task wasn’t necessary.

> The goal of the review is to check if the patch is suitable for the codebase.
>
> Even if the reviewer has other requests, they should not mix them into the code review.

---

#### The Double Team

Two reviewers take turns giving the developer different feedback.

When the developer follows one reviewer's feedback, the other reviewer gives conflicting feedback. This continues, and the developer ends up feeling exhausted.

> Reviewers should coordinate their opinions ahead of time and give consistent feedback.
>
> It’s important for both developers and reviewers to work towards the same guidelines.

---

#### The Guessing Game

The reviewer criticizes a design but doesn’t offer any clear alternatives.

The developer tries different solutions, but each time the reviewer rejects them.

> Feedback should be specific and clear.
>
> When criticizing, it’s helpful to offer the developer clear directions or alternatives.

---

#### The Priority Inversion

First, the reviewer points out minor issues, and later brings up major issues.

After the developer fixes all the small problems, they are told, "Actually, this whole section needs to be rewritten." As a result, all of the developer’s time and effort was wasted.

> It’s best to point out the most important issues first.
>
> If a big change will be needed later, hinting at it early on can help the developer.

---

#### The Late-Breaking Design Review

This happens when the reviewer only brings up major design issues after a lot of work has been done.

For example, during a bug fix review, the reviewer suddenly says, "Actually, this whole design is wrong." This forces the developer to undo all their previous work.

> If a major design change is needed, it’s better to suggest it during the early design phase.
>
> It’s not ideal to raise design issues during a minor review.

---

#### The Catch-22

The reviewer tells the developer to split up a large patch because it’s too hard to read, but when the patch is split, they say it’s too hard to understand each small patch on its own.

No matter what the developer does, they can’t satisfy the reviewer, leaving them confused.

> It’s important to give consistent feedback that matches the goal of the review.
>
> A flexible approach that allows for some compromise is necessary depending on the situation.

---

#### The Flip Flop

The developer follows the same approach as in previous tasks, but suddenly the reviewer rejects it.

Even though the developer tried to stay consistent, the reviewer changes their standards and asks for something new.

> Teams should have consistent coding guidelines and standards, and reviewers should stick to them.
>
> If something that was previously accepted is no longer valid, the reviewer should fix it themselves or create a separate task for it.

### In Conclusion

All these anti-patterns, whether intentional or not, can waste the developer’s time and motivation.

The reviewer’s role is to improve the quality of the code and work with the developer, so they should avoid unnecessary delays and inefficiency.

When given the authority to review, the reviewer should not misuse it, but instead use it responsibly.

It’s also important to provide clear and constructive feedback in line with the team's overall goals. That way, both the developer and the codebase can improve through the review process.
