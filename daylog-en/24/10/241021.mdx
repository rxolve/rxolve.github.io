The combined elements should belong to the same sub-element that includes both of them.

This is the first meaning of _cohesion_.

The second meaning is that uncombined elements should be moved elsewhere.

Let’s say we have a module with 10 functions.

Three of those functions are related. What happens to the remaining 7?

The first option is to group the related elements into their own sub-element.

Extracting helper functions is an example of this “extracting cohesive sub-elements” approach.

The second option is to move unrelated elements to a different place.

Where would they go? That’s where you become the software designer.

What should these functions be grouped with? Do they connect with each other?

But don’t move things around randomly—take it one step at a time.

Make sure your code stays neat for the next person who sees it.

If everyone follows the _Scout Rule_—“Leave the code better than you found it”—the code will become cleaner and more maintainable over time.
