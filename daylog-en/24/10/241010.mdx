I found out that we're experiencing intermittent 502 Bad Gateway errors in Beanstalk, thanks to a report from a colleague.

After checking the Nginx error logs, I discovered the presence of the `104: Connection reset by peer` error.

#### Cause Analysis

The "Connection reset by peer" error happens when the connection between the client and the server is interrupted in the middle.

This error can occur when Nginx sends a request to the backend server, and the server fails to handle the connection properly. While server overload or network instability could be the cause, in this case, it seemed to be due to a mismatch in the timeout settings between Nginx and the backend server, causing the connection to drop.

#### Solution

If the timeout settings in Nginx are too short, the connection might be cut off before the backend server can send a response.

To prevent this, I adjusted Nginxâ€™s timeout settings as follows:

```nginx
http {
    keepalive_timeout 65;  # Adjusted Keep-Alive connection time
    proxy_connect_timeout 120;  # Increased wait time for backend server connection
    proxy_read_timeout 120;  # Increased wait time for backend server response
    proxy_send_timeout 120;  # Increased wait time to send response to client
}
```

These settings give Nginx enough time when connecting to the backend server.

Additionally, I encountered the following warning and added the related settings:

```shell
could not build optimal types_hash, you should increase either types_hash_max_size: 1024 or types_hash_bucket_size: 64; ignoring types_hash_bucket_size
```

```nginx
http {
    ...
    types_hash_max_size 2048;  # Increased types_hash_max_size to 2048
    types_hash_bucket_size 64;  # Doubled types_hash_bucket_size to 64
}
```

After today's deployment, I plan to start monitoring from tomorrow.
