Continuing from yesterday, let's look at how to set the isolation level of a transaction using TypeORM's `QueryRunner`.

When starting a transaction, you can specify the isolation level as an argument in the `startTransaction()` method.

```typescript
import { getConnection } from "typeorm";

async function runTransaction() {
  // Create QueryRunner from the database connection
  const connection = getConnection();
  const queryRunner = connection.createQueryRunner();

  // Start the transaction and set the isolation level
  await queryRunner.startTransaction("READ COMMITTED");

  try {
    // Perform operations within the transaction
    // Example: Insert or update data
    await queryRunner.manager.save(/* entity */);

    // Commit the transaction
    await queryRunner.commitTransaction();
  } catch (error) {
    // Rollback if an error occurs
    await queryRunner.rollbackTransaction();
  } finally {
    // Release the QueryRunner
    await queryRunner.release();
  }
}
```

Here are the available options:

- `'READ UNCOMMITTED'`: Other transactions can read uncommitted data.
- `'READ COMMITTED'`: Only committed data can be read. This is the default setting in most DBMS.
- `'REPEATABLE READ'`: Reading the same data multiple times in a transaction will always return the same result.
- `'SERIALIZABLE'`: The highest isolation level, which makes transactions behave as if they are executed one after another, preventing conflicts with other transactions.
