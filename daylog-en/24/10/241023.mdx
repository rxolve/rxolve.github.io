Removing duplicate data is a common task in programming. In JavaScript, dealing with duplicates can be either simple or tricky, depending on the type of data. Today, we'll compare two approaches to handle primitive values and objects differently.

---

### Removing Duplicates: Primitive Values

A `Set` is a data structure that doesn’t allow duplicates. We can use this feature to easily remove duplicates from arrays with primitive values.

```javascript
const availableItems = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
const uniqueItems = Array.from(new Set(availableItems));
console.log(uniqueItems); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### Why use this method?

- Simple and straightforward.
- Works well for primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans.
- Performance: Creating a `Set` and converting it back to an array both take O(n) time.

#### What about objects?

```javascript
const availableItems = [{ id: 1 }, { id: 1 }];
const uniqueItems = Array.from(new Set(availableItems));
console.log(uniqueItems); // [{ id: 1 }, { id: 1 }]
```

- Objects are treated as reference types, meaning even if they have the same content, they are seen as different objects. So, duplicates won't be removed.

### Removing Duplicates: Objects

When dealing with objects, things get more complicated.  
Using `JSON.stringify`, we can turn objects into strings, compare them, and remove duplicates.

```javascript
const availableItems = [{ id: 1 }, { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }];
const uniqueItems = Array.from(
  new Set(availableItems.map((item) => JSON.stringify(item)))
).map((item) => JSON.parse(item));

console.log(uniqueItems);
// [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }]
```

#### How does this work?

1. Convert each object into a string using `JSON.stringify`.
2. Use a `Set` to remove duplicate strings.
3. Convert the strings back into objects with `JSON.parse`.

#### Advantages and Limitations

- Works well if objects with the same content need to be treated as duplicates.
- Order-sensitive: If the properties are in a different order, they won’t be considered duplicates.

```javascript
const availableItems = [
  { id: 1, name: "A" },
  { name: "A", id: 1 },
];
const uniqueItems = Array.from(
  new Set(availableItems.map((item) => JSON.stringify(item)))
).map((item) => JSON.parse(item));

console.log(uniqueItems);
// [{ id: 1, name: "A" }, { name: "A", id: 1 }]
```

Even though the two objects have the same content, they are treated as different objects because their property order differs.

### Which Method to Use and When?

| Method                               | When to Use                           | Things to Watch Out For              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Array.from(new Set(...))`           | Best for arrays with primitive values | Cannot remove duplicates for objects |
| `JSON.stringify` + `Set`             | Useful for removing duplicate objects | Sensitive to property order          |
| Libraries like `lodash`'s `uniqWith` | For more complex object comparisons   | Adds external dependencies           |

- For simple data, using a `Set` is the best approach.
- If you need to remove duplicate objects frequently, using libraries like `lodash` can simplify the process. For example, `_.uniqWith` allows you to customize the comparison logic.

---

### A Better Way to Handle Object Duplicates

If you need to ignore property order while comparing objects, you can write a deep comparison function.

```javascript
const deepEqual = (a, b) =>
  JSON.stringify(Object.entries(a).sort()) ===
  JSON.stringify(Object.entries(b).sort());

const uniqueItems = availableItems.filter(
  (item, index, self) =>
    index === self.findIndex((other) => deepEqual(item, other))
);

console.log(uniqueItems);
```

### In Summary

Choosing the right method to remove duplicates in JavaScript depends on the type of data you are working with.

- Use `Set` for primitive values — it's fast and easy.
- For objects, `JSON.stringify` can help, but it’s not perfect due to order sensitivity.
- For more complex cases, consider custom comparison logic or libraries like `lodash`.
