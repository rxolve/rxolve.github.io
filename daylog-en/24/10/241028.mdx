In business documents, there should be a hierarchy between paragraphs.

```
Hierarchy = Placement + Structure
```

Development tools can handle placement (2D) but can't capture structure (3D).

```js
var a;
var b;
if (a > b) {
  return a;
} else {
  return b;
}
```

Documents written by developers often have good placement but lack clear structure.

This is why planners or managers might feel like they’re reading a plain text file when looking at a developer's document.

For humans, reading a document without a clear structure makes it much harder to grasp the organization—unlike a computer.

Show structure in your writing. Help readers save time.

When writing, make sure hierarchy is clearly visible.
