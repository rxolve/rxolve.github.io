> [SLASH 24 - Removing Unnecessary Polling with SSE Event Push](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovGgdPPUZ2I)

Let’s dive into the key takeaways and explore why SSE was introduced and how it works.

## Why SSE Was Born: Polling Hell

In the past, sending real-time data from the server to the client wasn’t easy.

With HTTP 1.x, the server could only respond if the client made a request first. But as more systems needed real-time updates—like stock dashboards or notification systems—this model started showing its limits.

### Problems with Polling and Long Polling

At first, polling—sending requests repeatedly to check for new data—was a popular solution. However, it turned out to be quite inefficient. Even if there was no new data, the client would still send requests, which put a lot of unnecessary load on the server. This problem only grew worse with high traffic applications.

Then came long polling. In this method, the server holds the request open until new data becomes available before sending a response. But keeping these connections open for a long time became a burden on the server. Servers had to manage these connections, which consumed significant resources.

## Is WebSocket the Solution?

With the arrival of WebSocket, people thought, “Finally, a solution for real-time data!” WebSocket allowed bidirectional communication and required only one persistent connection. However, developers quickly found that it wasn’t always the perfect solution.

- Different protocol issues: WebSocket uses a protocol different from HTTP, which can cause trouble with proxies or firewalls.
- Overengineering: In cases where the server only needed to push data to the client (e.g., dashboards or notifications), WebSocket felt too complex.

This led to the question: “Do we really need WebSocket for simple server-to-client data pushes?”

## Introducing SSE: Real-time Data Made Simple

And that’s where Server-Sent Events (SSE) comes in. As the name suggests, SSE is a method where the server pushes data to the client in one direction. It runs on standard HTTP/1.1 infrastructure, meaning no need to learn new protocols or set up complex configurations.

### Advantages of SSE

- Automatic reconnection: If the connection is lost, the client automatically attempts to reconnect.
- Simple setup: The server just sends HTTP responses with the `text/event-stream` content type.
- Fully compatible with HTTP infrastructure: SSE works well with proxies and firewalls without any special configurations.

For large-scale systems where lightweight, one-way communication is sufficient, SSE becomes a much better fit than other solutions.

## When to Use SSE

SSE is ideal for applications that periodically push data from the server to the client. Here are some common use cases:

- Stock market dashboards: Pushing price updates in real-time.
- Notification systems: Sending alerts for new emails or system events.
- Log monitoring: Streaming logs from the server to a dashboard.
- Sports score updates: Showing live scores as the game progresses.

If bidirectional communication isn’t necessary, SSE is much easier to implement than WebSocket.

## SSE vs. WebSocket: Which One to Use?

Here’s a quick comparison to help you decide between SSE and WebSocket.

| Feature           | SSE                       | WebSocket                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Communication     | One-way (Server → Client) | Two-way (Server ↔ Client)      |
| Protocol          | HTTP-based                | WebSocket Protocol              |
| Auto-reconnection | Built-in                  | Needs manual implementation     |
| Proxy/firewall    | Works smoothly            | May encounter issues            |
| Use cases         | Alerts, dashboards        | Chat apps, gaming, two-way apps |

In summary, use SSE when you only need to send data from the server to the client. If you need full-duplex communication (both ways), go with WebSocket.

## How to Implement SSE with NestJS

Now, let’s look at a quick example of how to implement SSE in NestJS. NestJS works seamlessly with RxJS streams, making SSE even easier.

```typescript
// events.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get, Sse, MessageEvent } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Observable, interval, map } from "rxjs";

@Controller("events")
export class EventsController {
  @Sse()
  @Get()
  sendEvents(): Observable<MessageEvent> {
    return interval(1000).pipe(
      map((count) => ({
        data: { time: new Date().toISOString(), count },
      }))
    );
  }
}
```

This code sends the current time and a count to the client every second as a stream.

Now, let’s see how the client can receive this data using the `EventSource` object.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>NestJS SSE Demo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Server-Sent Events Demo</h1>
    <div id="events"></div>

    <script>
      const eventSource = new EventSource("/events");
      eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
        const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
        document.getElementById(
          "events"
        ).textContent = `Time: ${data.time}, Count: ${data.count}`;
      };
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This example demonstrates how the server sends data to the client every second and how the client displays it in real-time.

## Wrapping Up

Not every real-time system needs WebSocket. SSE was designed to solve the inefficiencies of polling and offer a simpler alternative to WebSocket for one-way data pushes.

If two-way communication isn’t required and the server only needs to send periodic updates, SSE is the way to go. It’s easier to implement, works well with existing HTTP infrastructure, and reduces unnecessary complexity.
