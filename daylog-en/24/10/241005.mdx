> A basic summary of Kubernetes, which I might need to set up someday.

#### What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It works similarly to AWS ECS or Elastic Beanstalk but offers a bigger ecosystem and more flexibility.

#### Comparing Kubernetes with AWS Services

| Kubernetes       | AWS Service         | Description                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pod              | ECS Task            | Smallest unit of deployment, contains one or more containers       |
| Node             | EC2 Instance        | Physical/virtual machine that runs the application                 |
| Cluster          | ECS Cluster         | Group of nodes, the whole Kubernetes system                        |
| Deployment       | ECS Service         | Manages application deployment and updates                         |
| Service          | ALB + Target Group  | Manages network access to the application                          |
| Ingress          | ALB Rules           | Rules for HTTP routing from outside to services inside the cluster |
| ConfigMap/Secret | SSM Parameter Store | Manages settings and secret information                            |

#### Benefits of Kubernetes

- **High Portability**: Supports multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments
- **Detailed Resource Management**: Allocates and manages resources at the container level
- **Declarative Configuration**: Stronger implementation of Infrastructure as Code philosophy
- **Self-healing**: Automatically recovers when failures happen
- **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks**: Seamless deployments and easy version control
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Built-in DNS-based service discovery
- **Scalability**: Can manage thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of pods

#### When to Switch?

- When you have a complex microservice architecture (more than 20 services)
- When you adopt a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud strategy
- If optimizing resource usage is needed (cloud costs over 30% of the budget)
- When you need more fine-tuned scaling control (scaling by the second)
- When high availability is required (99.99% uptime or more)
- When you need faster development, testing, and deployment cycles (releases in less than a day)
- When AWS services canâ€™t meet certain specific needs

#### Topics to Explore

- Deepening understanding of Docker containerization
- Learning basic Kubernetes concepts (Pod, Deployment, Service, etc.)
- Setting up a local Kubernetes environment using Minikube or kind
- Exploring AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- Practicing application deployment with Helm charts
- Learning Kubernetes networking and security policies
