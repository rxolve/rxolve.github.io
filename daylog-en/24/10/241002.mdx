Edward Yourdon and Larry Constantine conducted research while preparing their classic book, _Structured Design_, to figure out why some programs were more expensive to build.

They discovered that all expensive programs had one thing in common:

When you change one part of the program, you have to change another part too.

They called this "coupling," a characteristic where changes spread from one part of the system to another.

Simply looking at the source code isn't enough to analyze coupling. First, you need to know what changes have happened or are likely to happen.

We focus on coupling because it has two key properties:

- **One-to-Many (1-N)**: When a change happens, one part can be connected to many other parts.
- **Cascading**: Once a change occurs, it can spread from one part to another, triggering more changes along the way.

While development tools can help manage the one-to-many problem, cascading changes are more serious. The cost of changes tends to follow a power-law distribution.

By designing software carefully, we can reduce the likelihood and impact of cascading changes.

Over time, the term "coupling" has lost its original meaning and now often refers to any relationship between system elements.

In large, complex systems, coupling can be subtle. When we say a system is "complex," it often means that changes have unexpected consequences.

Take a moment to review a catalog of code-cleaning techniques and see how you can reduce coupling.

Coupling significantly affects software costs. Next, we'll explore how to manage it properly.
