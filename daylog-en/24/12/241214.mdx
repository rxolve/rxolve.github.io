title: 'Two Ways to Export MySQL Query Results to CSV Files'

When you need to export query results from MySQL to a CSV file, there are two commonly used approaches:

- Server-side file creation: using the `SELECT … INTO OUTFILE` statement
- Client-side file creation: using the `mysql` CLI + redirection (`>`) + `sed`

In this post, we'll look at the characteristics, limitations, and examples of each method, along with tips for adding headers, handling permissions, and more.

## Method 1. Using `INTO OUTFILE` (Server-side File Creation)

```sql
SELECT
  u.id            AS user_id,
  u.phone         AS phone,
  GROUP_CONCAT(CONCAT(ur.record_id, ',')
               ORDER BY ur.record_id
               SEPARATOR '') AS record_ids
FROM users AS u
INNER JOIN (
  SELECT DISTINCT user_id
  FROM memberships
) AS m ON u.id = m.user_id
LEFT JOIN user_records AS ur
  ON u.id = ur.user_id
GROUP BY
  u.id, u.phone
INTO OUTFILE '/var/lib/mysql-files/result.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
```

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics

- Saves the file directly to the server's file system
- Requires the MySQL user to have the `FILE` privilege
- The writable directory may be limited by the `secure_file_priv` setting
- Will fail if the file already exists (does not overwrite)

### 🔧 Check Configuration & Permissions

```sql
-- Check secure_file_priv path
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv';

-- Check FILE privilege
SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER();
```

## Method 2. Using `mysql` CLI + Redirection + `sed` (Client-side File Creation)

```bash
# 1) Prepare the output directory
mkdir -p /dev/dump

# 2) Add header + run query + format as CSV using sed
(
  # CSV header
  echo "user_id,phone,record_ids"

  # Run query (--batch: tab-separated, --raw: no escape characters)
  mysql -u your_user -p -D your_database \
    --batch --raw \
    -e "
      SELECT
        u.id            AS user_id,
        u.phone         AS phone,
        GROUP_CONCAT(CONCAT(ur.record_id, ',')
                     ORDER BY ur.record_id
                     SEPARATOR '') AS record_ids
      FROM users AS u
      INNER JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM memberships) AS m
        ON u.id = m.user_id
      LEFT JOIN user_records AS ur
        ON u.id = ur.user_id
      GROUP BY u.id, u.phone;
    "
) | sed 's/\t/\",\"/g; s/^/\"/; s/$/\"/' \
  > /dev/dump/result.csv
```

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics

- Saves the result directly to the local (client) machine
- Not affected by server settings like `secure_file_priv`
- Easy to manually add headers
- Uses `sed` to convert tab-separated values to properly quoted CSV format

## Notes & Considerations

1. Path Permissions

   - Ensure write permission for server (`INTO OUTFILE`) or local filesystem (`>`), depending on the method used

2. Preventing File Overwrites

   - If the target file already exists, consider backing it up or using a different filename

3. Character Encoding

   - For multibyte characters (e.g., Korean), use the `--default-character-set=utf8mb4` option:

   ```bash
   mysql … --default-character-set=utf8mb4 …
   ```

4. Large Datasets

   - To reduce network overhead, prefer `INTO OUTFILE` for exporting large datasets
   - The client-side method sends results over STDOUT, which may be slower

---

## Summary

- Use `INTO OUTFILE` if you want to leverage server-side resources
- Use the CLI + `sed` method if you have server restrictions or want to generate CSVs directly on your local environment

By choosing the right method for your situation, you can easily export MySQL query results into clean and usable CSV files.
