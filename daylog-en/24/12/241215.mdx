Zapier is an automation platform that connects various web applications and services.
Without writing a single line of code, you can create workflows (called “Zaps”) that perform specific actions when a certain trigger occurs — all with just a few clicks.
For example, you can set up a Zap to send a Slack notification when a new row is added to a Google Spreadsheet, or to automatically save certain Gmail emails to Evernote.

2. Trigger → Action Structure

   - Define custom triggers (e.g., new email, new lead, new comment).
