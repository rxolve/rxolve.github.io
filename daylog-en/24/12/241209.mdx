The **S3 Stream Wrapper** is a feature provided by the AWS SDK for PHP, allowing you to interact with objects in an S3 bucket as if they were local files using the `s3://` scheme (URI format).

---

## Why Use It?

- **Transparency**: You can work with S3 data using standard PHP file functions like `fopen()`, `fread()`, and `file_get_contents()`.
- **Convenience**: Instead of using complex `getObject()`/`putObject()` API calls, you can simply change the file path to reuse existing code.
- **Performance**: When only a portion of the file (like the header) is needed, it avoids downloading the whole file. Since it uses stream-based access, memory usage is minimized.

## How to Use

1. **Install the AWS SDK**

   ```bash
   composer require aws/aws-sdk-php
   ```

2. **Register the Stream Wrapper**

   ```php
   use Aws\S3\S3Client;

   // ① Create the S3 client
   $s3 = new S3Client([
       'version'     => 'latest',
       'region'      => 'ap-northeast-2',
       'credentials' => [
           'key'    => 'YOUR_AWS_KEY',
           'secret' => 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET',
       ],
   ]);

   // ② Register the S3 stream wrapper with PHP
   $s3->registerStreamWrapper();
   ```

3. **Use the `s3://` Path**

   ```php
   $bucket = 'my-bucket';
   $key    = 'path/to/file.wav';
   $uri    = "s3://{$bucket}/{$key}";

   // Example: Read only the header to calculate length
   $fp = fopen($uri, 'rb');
   $header = fread($fp, 44);
   fclose($fp);
   // ...parse header logic...
   ```

   Alternatively:

   ```php
   // Download the entire file
   copy($uri, '/local/path/file.wav');

   // Or read it directly into a string
   $contents = file_get_contents($uri);
   ```

## How It Works Internally

- The AWS SDK registers a handler for the `s3://` protocol in PHP’s stream wrapper registry.
- When you call `fopen('s3://...')`, the SDK internally triggers S3 API calls like `GetObject`, streaming the requested byte range.
- By default, range-based (partial) requests are supported, allowing efficient access to only the necessary parts of the file.

---

## Cautions

- The stream wrapper may be restricted or disabled in containerized or limited execution environments.
- Reading large files with `file_get_contents()` may cause memory issues — use stream-based functions like `fread()` instead.
- When writing (`fopen('s3://bucket/key', 'w')`), the entire object will be re-uploaded. For delta updates or multipart uploads, consider using the API directly.

With this setup, you can interact with S3 objects transparently, almost as if you're working with a local filesystem — all while reusing your existing file I/O code with minimal changes.
