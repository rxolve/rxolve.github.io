The `.cursorrules` file defines project-specific rules for the Cursor AI editor, helping the AI understand your coding style and architecture to generate consistent, high-quality code.  
Rules can be divided into Global Rules and Project Rules. With a simple Markdown syntax, you can define your team’s coding conventions, file structure, test coverage expectations, and more.  
This helps reduce code review time, accelerates onboarding for new team members, and automates repetitive tasks.

## Understanding `.cursorrules`

- **Global Rules**: Defined in Cursor's settings and applied across all projects.
- **Project Rules**: Defined in the `.cursorrules` file at the project root and applied only within that project.

---

## Creating the Rules File

1. Create a `.cursorrules` file in the project root.
2. Write rules using Markdown format.
3. Enable the “Include `.cursorrules` file” option in Cursor settings.

```markdown
# Example .cursorrules

## Code Style

- Always use TypeScript strict mode.
- Define interfaces explicitly.
- Avoid using the `any` type.

## Component Development (React)

- Use only functional components.
- Always define types for props.
- Use CSS Modules.

## Testing

- Maintain at least 80% unit test coverage.
- Use React Testing Library.
```

---

## Common Rule Types and Examples

#### Code Conventions

- **Naming**: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
- **File Structure**: Use directories like `components/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`
- **Style**: Line length of 80 characters, semicolon preference, tabs vs. spaces

#### Architecture Guidelines

- Separation of concerns: “One responsibility per file”
- Layered structure: Use `domain/`, `application/`, and `infrastructure/` directories

#### Automation & Validation

- Minimum test coverage comments
- Pre-commit hooks for linting and unit tests in CI pipelines

---

## Example Use Cases

#### NestJS API Project

```markdown
# NestJS Rules

- Controllers must be within 10 lines max.
- Services must not access DB directly (use Repositories).
- DTOs must always use class-validator decorators.
```

#### Next.js Static Blog

```markdown
# Next.js Blog Rules

- Page files must be located in `src/pages/**/*.tsx`
- Always use `getStaticProps`
- Use `Image` component to render all images
```

---

## Team Collaboration & Maintenance

- **Version Control**: Include the `.cursorrules` file in Git.
- **Documentation**: Summarize rules in your README.md.
- **Onboarding**: Ask new members to read the rules file.

---

## Pro Tips

- **Conditional Rules**: Use `@file` directives to define file-pattern-specific rules.
- **External References**: Use modular files under `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` for better structure and reuse.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Enable automatic suggestions when rules are violated.

## Conclusion

The `.cursorrules` file is not just a settings file for an AI tool—it’s your team’s **code manifesto**.  
A well-crafted set of rules can boost code quality tenfold, drastically reduce review times, and significantly improve team productivity.
