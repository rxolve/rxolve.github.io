## `undefined` vs `null`

#### `undefined`

- Represents "a value has not been assigned" at the JavaScript/TypeScript level.
- When calling TypeORM’s `save()` (or `insert()`), if a property is `undefined`, that column is excluded from the SQL query.
- If the column has a `@Column({ default: ... })` setting, the DB automatically fills it in with the DEFAULT value.

#### `null`

- Indicates an explicit intent to leave the value empty.
- TypeORM includes the property in the SQL query and performs `INSERT INTO ... (col) VALUES (NULL)` or `UPDATE ... SET col = NULL`.
- You must set `nullable: true` on the column for this to work without throwing an error.

## When the `default` Value Is Applied

1. Schema-level behavior:

   ```ts
   @Column({ default: 'guest' })
   role: string;
   ```

   Declaring it like this adds a constraint to the database:  
   `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN role varchar DEFAULT 'guest'`.

2. Application-level behavior:
   - If the property is `undefined` → the column is skipped in the query, and the DB’s DEFAULT is applied.
   - If the property is `null` → the DB’s DEFAULT is ignored, and `NULL` is stored instead.

## Development Tips

#### Use `undefined` for Partial Updates

Since `save()` skips properties that are `undefined`, it’s useful for updating only selected fields from a DTO.

```ts
const dto = { nickname: "junior" }; // Only want to update nickname!
await userRepository.save({ id: 1, ...dto });
// Only nickname gets updated; other fields remain untouched
```

#### When to Use `null` Intentionally

- If you want to clear a value (flush), assign `null` — but only after setting `nullable: true` on the column.
- To explicitly update a column to `NULL`, use `null` in your entity.

## Summary

| Value       | Included in Query   | Result                            |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `undefined` | Skipped             | DB DEFAULT may be applied         |
| `null`      | Explicitly included | `NULL` is stored; DEFAULT ignored |

- `undefined` → “Left off the order” → DEFAULT
- `null` → “Marked for removal” → NULL
