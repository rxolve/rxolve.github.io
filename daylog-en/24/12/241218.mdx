#### TypeORM

- A traditional ORM written purely in TypeScript/JavaScript that supports Active Record and Data Mapper patterns
- Entity definitions based on decorators (`@Entity()`, `@Column()`, etc.)
- Has a large community and ecosystem

#### Prisma

- Classified more as an “ORM-like data access tool” rather than a traditional ORM, defining models via its own DSL (Prisma Schema)
- Provides type-safe queries through the generated client API
- Built-in migration and seeding functionality

## Key Feature Comparison

| Aspect                    | TypeORM                                             | Prisma                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Model Definition**      | Entity classes with decorators                      | Define DSL in `schema.prisma` file, then run `prisma generate`           |
| **Query Method**          | Repository/QueryBuilder, Active Record              | Auto-generated `prismaClient` methods (e.g. `prisma.user.findMany`)      |
| **Type Safety**           | Limited (runtime validation)                        | Fully guaranteed at compile-time (e.g. `.findUnique()` signature checks) |
| **Migration**             | `typeorm migration:*` CLI                           | `prisma migrate` (automatic/manual)                                      |
| **Seeding**               | Requires separate scripts                           | Built-in via `prisma db seed`                                            |
| **Relation Setup**        | Explicit decorators like `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany` | Simple relation fields in schema                                         |
| **Performance**           | Slightly heavier due to runtime logic               | Lightweight client, relatively faster                                    |
| **Learning Curve**        | Lower if familiar with JS/TS entities               | Additional DSL and code generation step                                  |
| **Community & Ecosystem** | Long history with many plugins and integrations     | Rapidly growing, rich examples with GraphQL and Next.js                  |

## Pros and Cons

#### TypeORM

- **Pros**

  - Frequently used in official NestJS documentation examples
  - Entity definitions reside directly in code, making them intuitive
  - Simple CRUD implementation using Active Record pattern

- **Cons**

  - Runtime SQL query construction can lead to type mismatches
  - Migration conflicts can be troublesome to resolve
  - Maintenance pace has slowed somewhat recently

#### Prisma

- **Pros**

  - Complete type safety with query errors caught at compile time
  - Intuitive API like `prisma.user.create()`, `prisma.post.update()`
  - Automatically generated migration and seeding tools improve developer experience

- **Cons**

  - Requires learning its own DSL
  - Style differs from Active Record pattern, which some may prefer
  - May have limitations with large, complex queries (especially custom SQL)

## 4. When to Choose Which?

1. **Maintaining Existing TypeORM Projects**

   - If you already have hundreds of entities, optimizing TypeORM is recommended over switching to Prisma
   - If you are familiar with decorator-based code, you can maintain it without much hassle

2. **New Projects**

   - Choose **Prisma** if type safety and rapid development speed are top priorities
   - Choose **TypeORM** if pattern consistency (Active Record/Repository) and plugin integrations are important

3. **Complex Domain Logic**

   - For complex joins and custom SQL, TypeORM’s QueryBuilder offers more flexibility
   - For simple CRUD and relationship traversal, Prisma’s convenience shines

## NestJS Usage Tips

- **TypeORM**

  ```ts
  @Module({
    imports: [
      TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
        type: 'postgres',
        host: process.env.DB_HOST,
        // ...
        entities: [__dirname + '/../**/*.entity{.ts,.js}'],
        synchronize: false,
      }),
      TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User, Post]),
    ],
  })
  export class DatabaseModule {}
  ```

* **Prisma**

  1. Run `npx prisma init` and define `schema.prisma`
  2. Migrate with `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`
  3. Use in NestJS service

     ```ts
     @Injectable()
     export class UserService {
       constructor(private readonly prisma: PrismaClient) {}
       async findAll() {
         return this.prisma.user.findMany();
       }
     }
     ```

## Migration Considerations

- It is recommended to write separate migration scripts to safely reflect schema differences
- For large tables, plan downtime minimization strategies (partitioning, view switching, etc.)
- When migrating from TypeORM to Prisma:

  1. Try converting entities to Prisma schema using `typeorm-model-generator`
  2. Manually review fields and relations
  3. Gradually migrate (start new features with Prisma, keep existing ones on TypeORM)

## Conclusion

Both tools have their own strengths and advantages.
TypeORM offers a traditional ORM pattern with a rich ecosystem, while Prisma provides superior type safety and developer productivity.
Choosing depends on your project requirements, team familiarity, and migration costs.
