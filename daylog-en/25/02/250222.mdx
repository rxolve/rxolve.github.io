PostgreSQL’s LATERAL is a powerful tool that goes beyond a simple subquery.  
It works like a for-each loop by running a subquery for each row and allowing you to reference values from an outer table.

## 1. Basic Concept of LATERAL

Normally, a subquery can’t access columns from the outer query. However, with LATERAL, the subquery can reference columns from tables declared earlier in the FROM clause.  
In other words, a LATERAL subquery treats outer-scope columns as parameters and performs a separate calculation for each row.  
This greatly improves code readability and helps avoid redundant computations.

## 2. Basic Example

The following query retrieves, for each row in `base_table`, the event that has the closest `event_at` value greater than the current row's `event_at`:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM base_table t1
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT *
  FROM base_table t2
  WHERE t2.event_at > t1.event_at
  ORDER BY t2.event_at ASC
  LIMIT 1
) t2 ON true;
```

When you run this query, the subquery in each iteration uses t1’s `event_at` to fetch the nearest matching event from t2.  
Thanks to LATERAL, each row of t1 is used as a condition in the subquery—something that isn’t possible with a regular JOIN.

## 3. Practical Example

For instance, suppose you have a wishlist table and a product table. If you want to fetch the top 3 most recent products (under a specified price) for each wishlist, you can write:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM wishlist AS w,
LATERAL (
  SELECT *
  FROM product AS p
  WHERE p.price < w.desired_price
  ORDER BY p.price DESC
  LIMIT 3
) AS x
ORDER BY w.wishlist_id, p.price DESC;
```

In this query, the LATERAL subquery retrieves product data for each row in the wishlist based on its `desired_price`.  
Using LATERAL lets you easily pass values from the outer table into the subquery condition, which makes complex logic much cleaner.

## 4. Considerations When Using LATERAL

- Reference to Outer Scope:  
  A LATERAL subquery can only reference tables declared earlier in the FROM clause. Writing them in the wrong order may cause reference errors.

- Performance Considerations:  
  Since the subquery is executed for each row, large datasets can impact performance. Optimize by using proper indexing and analyzing the execution plan (using EXPLAIN).

- Differences in Other DBMS:  
  PostgreSQL provides robust LATERAL support, but other database systems (like MySQL) may have different syntax or behavior, so use caution when switching between systems.
