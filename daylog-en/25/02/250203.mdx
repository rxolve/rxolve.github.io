title: "Changing Notification Expiry Time When Copying DB"
date: "250203"

For QA, I copied the production database to use it as staging.

While discussing with the chapter one, I realized that notifications (KakaoTalk alimtalk, SMS, emails) might still be sent from the staging environment.

Checking the logs, I confirmed that notifications were being sent from both production and staging environments.

To prevent this, I adjusted all relevant expiration times for notifications based on today's date.

There was no major issue, but since this was an oversight during the process, I'm documenting it for future reference.
