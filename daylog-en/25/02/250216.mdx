JavaScript runs on a single thread by default (in browsers or Node.js),

so you usually don’t need mutexes like in traditional multi-threaded languages to prevent simultaneous access by multiple threads.

However, as you write more asynchronous code, multiple async functions might try to access shared resources (such as global variables or database connections) at the same time.

This can cause unexpected state changes or race conditions.

## How to Implement a Mutex in JS

Since JavaScript doesn’t have built-in mutexes,

you can either create one using Promises and async/await or use an external library.

### 1. Simple Mutex Implementation Example

```javascript
class Mutex {
  constructor() {
    this._queue = [];
    this._locked = false;
  }

  lock() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      if (this._locked) {
        // If the lock is already taken, wait in the queue
        this._queue.push(resolve);
      } else {
        // Acquire the lock immediately
        this._locked = true;
        resolve();
      }
    });
  }

  unlock() {
    if (this._queue.length > 0) {
      // Pass the lock to the next waiting function
      const nextResolve = this._queue.shift();
      nextResolve();
    } else {
      this._locked = false;
    }
  }
}

// Example usage:
const mutex = new Mutex();

async function criticalSection() {
  await mutex.lock();
  try {
    // Code that accesses shared resources
    console.log("Critical section start");
    // ... do some work ...
  } finally {
    mutex.unlock();
  }
}
```

This example shows a simple mutex.

It waits to acquire the lock and then, once done, it releases the lock so that the next waiting function can run.

### 2. Using an External Library

If you need a more robust solution for complex situations, you can use a library like [async-mutex](https://github.com/DirtyHairy/async-mutex).

This library helps you implement the mutex pattern safely in an asynchronous environment.

```javascript
const { Mutex } = require("async-mutex");
const mutex = new Mutex();

async function criticalSection() {
  const release = await mutex.acquire();
  try {
    console.log("Critical section with async-mutex");
    // Work on shared resources
  } finally {
    release();
  }
}
```

Using a library like async-mutex can simplify your code and provide a tested solution for managing shared resources in asynchronous code.
