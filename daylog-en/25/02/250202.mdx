Blocking and non-blocking determine whether other tasks can run while a given task is being processed.
To understand this better, let's think about I/O (input/output) operations.

## Blocking

In blocking mode, you have to wait until the task is completed before moving on to the next one.

#### Example: Restaurant with only one chef

- A customer orders food, and the chef starts cooking.
- The chef does not take another order until the first dish is ready.
- Only after finishing the current dish can they take the next order.

#### Code Example (Synchronous Blocking)

```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";

// Read file (Blocking)
const data = fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf-8");
console.log(data); // Prints after the file is fully read

console.log("Next task"); // Runs only after file reading is complete
```

- `fs.readFileSync()` blocks execution until the file is fully read.
- The next line of code runs only after reading is done.

## Non-blocking

In non-blocking mode, you donâ€™t have to wait for the task to finish before moving on.

#### Example: Restaurant with a waiter

- A customer orders food, and the chef starts cooking.
- Meanwhile, the waiter takes other orders instead of waiting.
- When the food is ready, the waiter notifies the customer.

#### Code Example (Asynchronous Non-blocking)

```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";

// Read file (Non-blocking)
fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf-8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data); // Runs when the file is fully read
});

console.log("Next task"); // Runs before file reading is complete
```

- `fs.readFile()` does not block execution.
- The next line (`console.log("Next task")`) runs before the file reading is done.
- The callback function runs when the file is fully read.

## Summary

|          | Blocking                             | Non-blocking                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Behavior | Waits until the task is done         | Moves to the next task immediately        |
| Pros     | Simple and easy to understand        | High performance, handles many tasks      |
| Cons     | Slower, hard to handle many requests | Can be more complex (callbacks, Promises) |
| Examples | `readFileSync`, database queries     | `readFile`, API requests (event loop)     |
