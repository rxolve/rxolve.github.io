AAS (Average Active Sessions) is a key database performance metric that shows the average number of active sessions at the same time over a given period.

#### AAS

- A key metric to measure database load
- The average number of sessions that are running or waiting on CPU or I/O during a specific time
- Higher values indicate possible system overload

### Formula

AAS = DB Time / Elapsed Time

- DB Time: Total time sessions spend waiting or actively running
- Elapsed Time: Total time measured

### Interpreting AAS

- AAS < vCPU count → Normal load
- AAS ≈ vCPU count → Near performance limit
- AAS > vCPU count → Possible CPU bottleneck
