Not only programmers but many jobs have the "Nice Person Complex."

However, developers often fall into this trap more easily.

They don’t want to disappoint others or create conflict, so they accept unreasonable requests instead of saying no.

This often looks like:

- "Can you do this?" → "Yes, I'll try!" (Even if it’s difficult or impossible)
- "Can we meet this deadline?" → "I'll do my best!" (Even if the schedule is already tight)
- "Can we add this feature?" → "Hmm... I think we can!" (Without considering the risks)

This might seem good for teamwork in the short term, but in the long run, it leads to burnout, delays, and technical debt.

Developers solve problems, but we can’t solve everything.

Saying "I can't do it" might feel like admitting weakness. But actually, acknowledging limits and offering alternatives builds trust.

Saying "I don’t know this well" isn’t embarrassing—development is all about continuous learning.

Also, blindly saying "I'll do it" increases technical debt and harms the team.

Developers don’t just write code—we are responsible for system health.

Suggest alternatives, explain logically, and share with the team instead of taking everything alone.

Don't be just a nice developer—be a good developer.
