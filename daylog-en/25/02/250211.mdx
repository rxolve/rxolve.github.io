When using Swagger in NestJS, you can indicate whether a response field is nullable by setting the `nullable` property in the `@ApiProperty` decorator.

However, you might notice that the red asterisk (★) in the schema doesn’t disappear.

To fix this, you need to explicitly set `required: false`.

Alternatively, you can use the `@ApiPropertyOptional` decorator for a simpler solution.
