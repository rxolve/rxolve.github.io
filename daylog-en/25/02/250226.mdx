The Kubestronaut Program is an honor that shows you have deep knowledge and real-world experience with Kubernetes and the cloud-native ecosystem.

This program, run by the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation), requires you to pass all five of these certifications:

- Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA)
- Kubernetes and Cloud Security Associate (KCSA)
- Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
- Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)
- Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)

You must keep all these certifications active to earn the Kubestronaut title.

Each exam tests your skills on everything from the basics of Kubernetes to cluster management, application development, and security.

And best of allâ€”you get a cool jacket!

In an industry where cloud skills are essential, this is a title worth striving for.
