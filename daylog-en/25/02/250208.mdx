Structured concurrency is a pattern in asynchronous programming that groups and manages multiple tasks within a clear scope.

Simply put, when a parent task creates child tasks, structured concurrency ensures that all the child tasks complete before the parent task finishes.

#### Key Features

- **Clear Lifecycle Management**

  All asynchronous tasks created within a parent function or block must complete before that scope ends.

  This prevents "orphaned tasks" and makes the execution flow predictable.

- **Error Propagation and Cancellation**

  If any child task throws an exception, the structured concurrency mechanism helps propagate the error to the parent or cancels the entire group of tasks.

  This simplifies complex error handling.

- **Improved Code Readability and Maintainability**

  Grouping asynchronous tasks together clarifies the code flow and makes debugging and maintenance easier.

#### Example (Python Trio's Nursery Concept)

The Python Trio library is a great example of structured concurrency.

In Trio, you use the `async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery:` statement, which waits for all tasks started in the nursery to finish before exiting the block.

```python
import trio

async def child_task(name):
    print(f"{name} started")
    await trio.sleep(1)
    print(f"{name} finished")

async def main():
    async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery:
        nursery.start_soon(child_task, "Task 1")
        nursery.start_soon(child_task, "Task 2")

trio.run(main)
```

In this example, the `main` function opens a nursery and starts two tasks concurrently.

The nursery ensures that `main` does not complete until both tasks are finished.

#### Conclusion

Structured concurrency lets you manage asynchronous tasks within a defined scope, ensuring effective error handling and cancellation.

This pattern improves code stability, readability, and predictability when working with complex asynchronous logic.
