This post explains how to search for rows in a PostgreSQL table where a JSONB column contains a key that includes a specific substring (e.g., "option"). It also covers how to use the `jsonb_object_keys()` function to achieve this.

## What is the jsonb_object_keys() Function?

The `jsonb_object_keys()` function returns all the keys from the top-level JSONB object as a set of text values. This allows you to expand each key into individual rows for easier processing.

For example, consider the following JSONB data:

```sql
SELECT jsonb_object_keys('{"name": "Alice", "option_enabled": true, "age": 30}'::jsonb) AS key;
```

This query returns:

| key            |
| -------------- |
| name           |
| option_enabled |
| age            |

In other words, you can extract each top-level key from a JSONB object.

## Searching for Keys Containing a Specific Substring

In real-world scenarios, you may need to filter rows where the JSONB data contains a key that includes a certain word. For instance, if you want to select rows where a key contains "option", you can use one of the following methods.

### Using a Subquery with EXISTS

Assume you have a table named `my_table` with a JSONB column called `data`. You can extract the top-level keys for each row and check if any key contains the substring "option" using the `ILIKE` operator:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_table
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM jsonb_object_keys(data) AS key
  WHERE key ILIKE '%option%'
);
```

How it works:

- jsonb_object_keys(data): Extracts all top-level keys from the JSONB column `data`.
- ILIKE '%option%': Checks the keys for any that contain the string "option" (case-insensitive).
- EXISTS: Returns the row if at least one key meets the condition.

### Using JOIN with LATERAL

Another approach is to use a LATERAL JOIN, which explicitly expands the keys for each row and then filters based on the condition:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT t.*
FROM my_table t,
LATERAL jsonb_object_keys(t.data) AS key
WHERE key ILIKE '%option%';
```

How it works:

- LATERAL jsonb_object_keys(t.data) AS key: Expands the keys from the JSONB column `data` for each row and joins them with the row.
- DISTINCT: Removes duplicate rows if multiple keys in the same row match the condition.
