Rollback netcode is a technology that innovatively solves the input latency issues common in online fighting games.

In an offline environment, every input is almost instant. However, online, network latency can cause the timing of inputs between players to vary.

#### Delay Netcode vs. Rollback Netcode

Delay Netcode adds a fixed, artificial delay to every player's input to keep them in sync.  
While this method is simple to implement, it results in input delays for all players, reducing the game's responsiveness.

Rollback Netcode, on the other hand, shows a player's input on screen as soon as it is made.  
When the opponent's input finally arrives, if there’s any difference from the predicted input, the game state is "rolled back" and recalculated with the correct input.  
If the prediction is accurate, the rollback is barely noticeable, which minimizes the impact of network latency.

#### How Rollback Netcode Works

1. Input Prediction  
   Each client predicts the opponent’s input using past patterns or default behaviors and immediately reflects that prediction on screen—even before the actual input arrives.

2. Real-time Synchronization  
   When the actual input data comes in, the client checks if it matches the prediction.  
   If it doesn’t, the game state is rolled back to that moment and then updated with the correct input.

3. Minimized Perceived Latency  
   If network conditions are good, predictions are mostly accurate, so rollbacks occur rarely.  
   This means players experience responsiveness that is nearly as good as playing offline.
