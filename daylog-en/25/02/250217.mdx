#### Issue

In AdminJS, if you use a primary key column other than id, it does not appear on the edit page.

#### Resolution

Set the isVisible property of the primary key column in the resource's options - properties to true.

```typescript
return {
  resource: SubjectEntity,
  options: {
    properties: {
      subject: {
        isVisible: { list: true, show: true, edit: true, filter: true },
      },
      // ...
    },
  },
};
```

It is recommended to use the id column as the primary key if possible.
