Are you ready to answer the question: "Should we tidy up first?"

Every time you code, you are influenced by four forces.

- Cost, Benefit, Coupling, and Cohesion

But the most important factor is you.

When you work in your best state and take ownership of your code, you become a better programmer.

This book, the first in the series, focused on software design by individuals, for individuals.

The next book in this series will explore the relationships between the people who have the power to change a system.

The ultimate reward of mastering these great skills is improving how you collaborate with others.

The goal is to make software design a genuine, human-centered activity.

So, **should you tidy up first?** Probably. And that’s the point. Yes, because it’s worth it—for you.

> As I wrapped up this book, I realized the importance of both code tidiness and architecture.

> It also made me want to become a developer who writes better articles.
