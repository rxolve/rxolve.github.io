Turing's diagonalization argument is an adaptation of the diagonalization method that Georg Cantor used to compare the sizes of infinite sets.

The core idea is to use self-reference and contradiction to show that certain problems cannot be solved.

#### Diagonalization Argument

Turing observed that every program can be written as a finite string. This means we can list all programs in order.

1. Imagine that you can number every program as P1, P2, P3, and so on.
2. Now, assume there is a hypothetical function `H(P, I)` that tells you whether a program `P` halts when given input `I`:

   - If `H(P, I) = True`, then program `P` stops when running on input `I`.
   - If `H(P, I) = False`, then program `P` goes into an infinite loop with input `I`.

3. Next, design a special program called `D`:

   - This program `D` looks at what `H(P, P)` returns and does the opposite.
   - In other words, if `H(P, P) = True`, then `D` goes into an infinite loop.
   - If `H(P, P) = False`, then `D` stops running.

4. Now, consider what happens when you run `D` on itself, i.e., compute `D(D)`:
   - If `H(D, D) = True`, then according to the definition, `D` should halt—but it is designed to loop forever. That’s a contradiction!
   - If `H(D, D) = False`, then `D` should loop forever—but by design, it halts immediately. That’s also a contradiction!

This contradiction shows that the function `H` cannot exist. Therefore, the halting problem is undecidable.

#### Diagonalization and Other Proofs of Undecidability

The diagonalization method is not only used to prove the halting problem is undecidable but also in other areas of mathematics and logic:

- Cantor's Diagonal Argument: Demonstrates that the set of real numbers is larger than the set of natural numbers (i.e., the real numbers are uncountable).
- Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem: Uses a similar idea to show that there are true statements in mathematics that cannot be proven.
- Undecidability in Computer Science: Proves that it is generally impossible to decide if a program has a certain property.
