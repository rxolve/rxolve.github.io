title: "AWS Lambda Deployment: Code Storage Limit Exceeded"

#### Problem

The "Code storage limit exceeded" error in AWS Lambda happens when the total function code storage exceeds the limit.

By default, AWS allows 100GB of storage per account for Lambda functions.

Every time you deploy a Lambda function, AWS creates a new version without deleting the old ones.

If you frequently update your Lambda functions, old versions accumulate, eventually exceeding the storage limit.

#### Solution

Check all your Lambda functions in the AWS Lambda console and delete any unused functions.

If you're using Serverless Framework, you can use the serverless-prune-plugin to automatically remove old versions.

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-prune-plugin

custom:
  prune:
    automatic: true # Runs automatically after deployment
    number: 5 # Keeps only the last 5 versions (deletes older ones)
```
