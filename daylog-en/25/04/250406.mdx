> I've compiled a summary of `100 Miracle Words for English Speaking` written by Professor William A. Vance of Yale.

#### When Cutting Decisively, Use **cut** Instead of **reduce**

- Using **cut** in the sense of "to shorten or trim" conveys energy and decisiveness, leaving a strong impression.

#### For a Sense of Mutual Communication, Use **share** Instead of **tell**

- Replacing **tell** with **share** to mean "to speak" expresses a desire to exchange thoughts and experiences, ultimately leading to positive outcomes.

#### When Everyone Says **try** to Strive, Use **aim** to Show Maximum Effort

- Using **aim** instead of **try** to mean "to strive" communicates a determined drive, suggesting that you are putting your utmost effort toward your goal.

#### When Executing Tasks Organically, Use **build** Instead of **make**

- In a work context, substituting **make** with **build** implies that the task is being planned and executed in a structured, step-by-step manner.

#### For Casual Mention Use **say**, but for a Refined Tone, Use **note**

- Choosing **note** over **say** in the sense of "to mention" conveys a polite and deliberate emphasis on important details.
