## Why Do Duplicates Occur?

When multiple identical API POST requests arrive simultaneously, multiple threads (or processes) may attempt to access the database at nearly the same time.

Some key reasons include:

- Race Condition: If multiple requests try to insert data at the same time, one request may insert first while others attempt to insert the same data, leading to duplication.
- Non-Idempotency: POST requests are inherently non-idempotent, meaning that sending the same request multiple times creates new resources each time.

## Approaches to Prevent Duplicates

### Database-Level Unique Constraints

#### Explanation:

- You can define a unique constraint on specific columns (e.g., user ID, order number, status) to prevent duplication.
- For example, in MySQL, you can define a composite unique key as follows:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE orders (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      user_id INT NOT NULL,
      order_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
      amount DECIMAL(10,2),
      -- Other columns...
      UNIQUE KEY unique_order (user_id, order_number, status)
  ) ENGINE=InnoDB;
  ```

#### Pros:

- Ensures complete prevention of duplicate inserts at the database level, regardless of application logic errors.

#### Cons:

- If concurrent insert attempts violate the constraint, an exception occurs, requiring the application to handle it properly.
- In some cases, database lock contention may impact performance.

### Using an Idempotency Key

#### Explanation:

- Clients send a unique Idempotency Key (e.g., a UUID) with each POST request.
- The server checks whether the request has already been processed:
  - If the key exists: The server returns the previous result or ignores the request.
  - If the key does not exist: The request is processed, and the key is stored.

#### Pros:

- Effectively prevents duplicate processing at both client and server levels.
- Ensures safe retries in case of network failures.

#### Cons:

- If clients fail to manage the key properly, duplicate detection may be unreliable.
- The server needs additional storage (e.g., memory, Redis, or a database) to track idempotency keys.

### Distributed Locking

#### Explanation:

- Uses a distributed cache system like Redis to acquire a lock before processing the request.
- For example, using a unique identifier such as `"order:12345"` as the lock key ensures that only one request proceeds while others wait or fail.

#### Pros:

- Ensures only one request is processed in multi-server environments.
- Useful for handling high traffic bursts.

#### Cons:

- Increases system complexity due to additional lock acquisition and release logic.
- Requires careful management of lock expiration and release timing.

### Request Queuing

#### Explanation:

- All POST requests are added to a queue and processed sequentially.
- Message queue systems (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) can be used to guarantee order and serialize request processing.

#### Pros:

- Guarantees request order and prevents duplicate creation.
- Works well under high traffic conditions.

#### Cons:

- Increases architectural complexity.
- Introduces response delays due to sequential processing.

## Combining Strategies

In real-world production environments, a single approach may not cover all scenarios. A combined strategy is usually more effective:

- Database Unique Constraints: Serve as a final safeguard against duplicate inserts.
- Idempotency Keys: Prevent duplicates at the API level and ensure safe retries.
- Distributed Locking: Useful for critical operations like payment processing.

By implementing multiple layers of protection, you can minimize failure points and improve overall system reliability.
