#### Type Safety

Using string literal types restricts the values that can be assigned to a variable to a predefined set. For example, you can define a type representing different states as follows:

```typescript
type Status = "pending" | "approved" | "rejected";
let currentStatus: Status = "pending"; // Valid usage
currentStatus = "processing"; // Compilation error!
```

If an incorrect value is assigned, a compile-time error occurs immediately. This helps prevent runtime errors and contributes to writing more stable code.

#### Self-Documentation

String literal types clearly indicate which values are allowed for a variable or function argument. For example, when implementing an event handler, you can write:

```typescript
type MouseEventName = "click" | "dblclick" | "mousedown" | "mouseup";

function registerEventHandler(event: MouseEventName, handler: () => void) {
  // Event registration logic
}

registerEventHandler("click", () => console.log("Clicked!")); // OK
registerEventHandler("mouseover", () => console.log("Mouseover!")); // Compilation error!
```

Just by looking at the code, it is clear that only "click", "dblclick", "mousedown", and "mouseup" are valid values. This improves code readability for both colleagues and your future self.

#### IDE Autocompletion and Productivity Boost

String literal types integrate seamlessly with IDEs and editors that provide autocompletion features.
For example, when using the `MouseEventName` type, the IDE will suggest valid values while writing code, helping prevent typos and enabling faster development.

This reduces the burden of repeatedly typing values and significantly speeds up code writing.

#### Ease of Refactoring and Maintenance

Since the allowed values are defined in a single place, modifying or adding new values only requires updating the type definition.
The compiler will automatically highlight any incompatible changes, reducing the risk of errors during refactoring.

Additionally, using the same type consistently throughout the codebase ensures consistency and makes long-term maintenance easier.

#### Strong Type Safety Without Runtime Overhead

String literal types exist only during compile-time for type checking. At runtime, they are treated as regular strings, meaning no additional runtime code is introduced.
This provides type safety while avoiding unnecessary increases in JavaScript bundle size.

#### Summary

String literal types offer several advantages:

- Type Safety: Restricts values to predefined options, preventing incorrect assignments.
- Self-Documentation: Clearly defines allowed values, making code easier to understand.
- IDE Support: Enhances developer productivity through autocompletion.
- Ease of Refactoring: Centralized value definitions simplify maintenance.
- Zero Runtime Overhead: Type checking occurs at compile time, ensuring stability without affecting runtime performance.
