## Universals

In philosophy, a universal refers to a "shared essence" inherent in multiple individual entities or phenomena. Much like Plato’s theory of forms, a universal is a fundamental property that different concrete instances resemble. In the world of programming, this concept often manifests through abstract classes or interfaces, but it also plays a crucial role in variable naming.

A variable name is more than just a symbol. A well-chosen name reveals the universal concept—the “meaning” the code is trying to express—and offers shared understanding to anyone reading the code.

## Universal Thinking in Variable Naming

### Choosing Variable Names

A common dilemma when naming variables is this:  
“How abstract is the concept I’m trying to express?”

- Overly specific variable names:  
  When a name includes too much detail, it may limit reusability or general applicability. For example, `averageOfStudentScoresForMath` may be clear in one context, but overly restrictive elsewhere.

- Overly abstract variable names:  
  Conversely, names like `data` or `info` are so generic that they fail to communicate any real meaning, making the code harder to understand.

The key is to maintain a universal perspective while selecting the appropriate level of abstraction based on context. Every name should answer the question:  
“What role does this variable play, and what universal concept does it represent?”

### Balancing Abstraction and Concreteness

While the idea of a universal lies at the heart of abstraction, it must also be adjusted to fit specific situations—this includes naming variables.

- Universal names (e.g., `result`, `counter`, `buffer`):  
  These names express abstract concepts that can be reused across various contexts.

- Specific names (e.g., `userAge`, `sessionToken`):  
  These clarify the use of a variable and make the code’s intent immediately apparent.

The two approaches are complementary. Naming strategies grounded in universal concepts help modularize code and express abstract design principles while still allowing for concrete implementation when needed.

## A Simple Example

Let’s look at how variable names can reflect both abstraction and concreteness in a function that processes generalized data.

```typescript
// Abstract variable name representing a universal concept
let items: any[] = fetchData();
// Here, 'items' acts as a universal container that can hold various types of data.

// General-purpose data processing function
function processItems(data: any[]): any[] {
  const processed: any[] = [];
  for (const item of data) {
    // The processing logic may depend on the item’s structure, but the variable name expresses its universal role.
    processed.push(transform(item));
  }
  return processed;
}

// Concrete variable names reflecting specific contexts
const userProfiles: UserProfile[] = filterUserProfiles(items);
const sessionTokens: string[] = extractSessionTokens(items);
```

In this code, the name `items` is intentionally abstract—it doesn’t indicate the specific type or content of the data. Instead, its meaning is inferred from the context of the surrounding code.  
On the other hand, names like `userProfiles` or `sessionTokens` are purposefully specific, improving readability and maintainability.

## In Closing

A good variable name bridges the abstract concepts within code and the concrete requirements of implementation. It clearly expresses the developer’s intended meaning and fosters a shared understanding among all who read it.
