## Basic Concepts

#### OKR (Objectives and Key Results)

- Objectives: Ambitious and inspirational qualitative goals that the team wants to achieve.
  - Example: "Revolutionize the user experience to significantly improve customer satisfaction."
- Key Results: Measurable indicators that track the achievement of objectives with specific numbers.
  - Example: "Maintain customer satisfaction score above 80", "Increase app retention rate by 20%"
- Characteristics:
  - Challenging: If you achieve 100%, the goal was likely too easy. Typically, 70% achievement is seen as ideal.
  - Transparency: OKRs are shared across teams and the organization so everyone moves in the same direction.
  - Autonomy: Goals are set bottom-up, encouraging individuals to self-motivate and work with ownership.

#### KPI (Key Performance Indicators)

- Core performance metrics that measure the operational health and outcomes of the organization in quantitative terms.
  - Example: "Monthly revenue", "Bug fix rate", "Average response time"
- Characteristics:
  - Stable measurement: Aiming for 100% achievement and reflects the current operational state.
  - Performance evaluation: Often directly tied to bonuses and employee reviews.
  - Continuous monitoring: Regularly tracked to quickly identify areas needing improvement.

## Key Differences Between OKRs and KPIs

| Category    | OKR                                                | KPI                                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Set ambitious goals and drive progress             | Measure current operational status and outcomes    |
| Measurement | Qualitative goals + quantitative key results       | Purely quantitative metrics (e.g. revenue, output) |
| Achievement | 70% is considered ideal and motivating             | Aims for full (100%) achievement                   |
| Incentives  | Encourages challenge, not directly tied to rewards | Often linked to evaluations and financial rewards  |
| Visibility  | Public and shared across the organization          | Typically tracked by managers, limited visibility  |

## When to Use OKRs vs KPIs?

- OKRs:

  - When innovation and breakthrough are needed  
    e.g., launching new features or drastically improving user experience.
  - When team motivation and alignment are critical  
    OKRs help boost autonomy in teams that are ready to own and drive their own goals.

- KPIs:
  - For monitoring routine operational performance  
    Useful for ensuring stable service, productivity, and quality management.
  - As part of performance/reward systems  
    KPIs are commonly used in evaluations and bonus calculations due to their clarity and consistency.

## In Closing

OKRs are about driving change through ambitious objectives, while KPIs help measure the outcomes and health of that change.

When used together effectively in the field, OKRs and KPIs ensure that all team members are aligned toward a common direction, pursuing bold goals, while also maintaining and monitoring the everyday performance of the organization.
