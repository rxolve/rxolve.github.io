When processing background jobs with BullMQ, tracking job progress is a crucial factor in enhancing user experience and debugging issues.  
Traditionally, the most common approach is calling `job.progress()` within the job processor function to update the progress status.  
This method is simple and intuitive, allowing clients or monitoring systems to receive feedback on job execution status.

#### Tracking Progress with job.progress()

Updating the progress within the job processing logic is straightforward:

```javascript
queue.process(async (job) => {
  // Initial state: 0% progress
  await job.progress(0);

  // Execute part of the job
  await doStepOne(job.data);
  await job.progress(50); // 50% completed

  // Process the remaining steps
  await doStepTwo(job.data);
  await job.progress(100); // Job completed

  return "result";
});
```

As shown in the code above, calling `job.progress()` at the end of each job step updates the progress.  
This allows external systems to receive updates via BullMQ's 'progress' event.  
For example, you can set up an event listener as follows:

```javascript
queue.on("progress", (job, progress) => {
  console.log(`Job ${job.id} progress: ${progress}`);
});
```

This approach works well for simple jobs or when progress changes in a linear manner.
