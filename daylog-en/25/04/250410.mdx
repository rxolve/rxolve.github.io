PostgreSQL supports both physical replication (replicating data at the block level) and logical replication (replicating individual tuple-level changes).  
While MySQL refers to this as "binary logs," PostgreSQL relies on its internal Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) system.  
Logical replication interprets WAL records "logically" and transmits data through a publish-subscribe model.

## Overview of Logical Replication

#### Physical vs. Logical Replication

- Physical Replication (Streaming Replication):

  - Transfers WAL data as-is (in binary) to create an identical disk image on the standby server.
  - Downsides: Requires the same PostgreSQL version and architecture. Cannot selectively replicate specific tables or partial data.

- Logical Replication:

  - Decodes WAL entries into logical changes like individual INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
  - Operates on a publish (publication) and subscribe (subscription) model, allowing selective replication of specific tables or subsets of data. Works across different versions and platforms.
  - However, DDL changes (e.g., schema alterations) are not replicated by default.

## How Logical Replication Works

### Key Components

- WAL (Write-Ahead Log):  
  A log that records all changes to data. PostgreSQL uses it for both crash recovery and replication. Logical replication extracts changes from WAL through a process called logical decoding.

- Logical Decoding & Output Plugin:  
  Interprets binary WAL entries and converts them into SQL-level INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations. PostgreSQL uses the built-in `pgoutput` plugin by default, but custom plugins can also be used.

- Publication & Subscription:

  - Publication: Defines the set of tables or data to be replicated.

    ```sql
    ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;  -- Set wal_level to logical (requires restart)
    SELECT pg_reload_conf();

    CREATE PUBLICATION my_pub FOR TABLE mytable;
    ```

  - Subscription: Connects to a publication and receives changes. The subscriber can read from and optionally write to replicated tables.

    ```sql
    CREATE SUBSCRIPTION my_sub
      CONNECTION 'host=primary_host port=5432 dbname=postgres user=replicator password=secret'
      PUBLICATION my_pub;
    ```

#### Replication Process

1. Initial Synchronization  
   When a subscription is created, the snapshot of the source tables is sent to the subscriber to initialize the data.

2. Streaming Changes in Real Time  
   After synchronization, the publisher continues to decode WAL entries into logical operations and streams them to the subscriber.

   - The publisher reads new WAL entries, converts them via the output plugin into INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE messages, and sends them using a `walsender` process.
   - The subscriber’s `apply worker` receives the messages and applies them locally in the same transaction order.

3. Status Updates  
   The subscriber reports back the latest WAL LSN (Log Sequence Number) it has applied. This allows the publisher to manage disk space by retaining only the necessary WAL files.

## Configuration Considerations

#### Important Server Settings

- wal_level:  
  Must be set to `logical` to enable logical replication.

  ```conf
  wal_level = logical
  ```

- max_replication_slots & max_wal_senders:  
  Sufficient slots and sender processes must be allocated.

  ```conf
  max_replication_slots = 10
  max_wal_senders = 10
  ```

- pg_hba.conf Configuration:  
  Access control must be configured to allow replication.

  ```conf
  host    replication    replicator    192.168.1.0/24    md5
  ```

#### Structural Constraints & Limitations

- No DDL Replication:  
  CREATE, ALTER, DROP (schema changes) are not automatically replicated. Schema must be manually synchronized beforehand.

- Sequences & Large Objects Not Replicated:  
  These need to be managed manually.

- Table Requirements:  
  Tables must have a primary key or a unique index. If not, `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` must be set, which can degrade performance.

- Limitations:
  - Subscribers can write to the replicated tables, but conflicts may occur if changes overlap with replicated data.
  - After initial sync, only DML changes are transmitted. Any inconsistencies must be manually resolved.

## Conclusion

PostgreSQL’s logical replication leverages its WAL mechanism to replicate data at a fine-grained level across databases.

- Benefits:

  - Selective replication of specific tables or subsets of data.
  - Works across different versions or platforms.
  - Subscribers can be used not only for read scaling but also for active-active data applications.

- Drawbacks:
  - No support for DDL, sequences, or large object replication by default.
  - Requires careful monitoring of the replication process, especially around initial sync and status reporting.

In production environments, third-party tools like ClusterControl, EDB solutions, and Severalnines are often used to automate replication setup, monitoring, and failover handling.

With logical replication, PostgreSQL enables greater scalability, high availability, and data mobility—such as transferring data between OLTP and OLAP systems.
