In production, when a query runs too long and holds onto a session, it can lead to degraded database performance and delayed application responses.  
PostgreSQL provides the `pg_stat_activity` view for monitoring currently running queries and session states, and the `pg_terminate_backend` function to terminate problematic sessions when necessary.

## Monitoring Running Queries

#### pg_stat_activity

`pg_stat_activity` is a system view in PostgreSQL that provides useful information about all active sessions, their states, and the start time of currently running queries.  
By leveraging this view, you can easily identify long-running queries and sessions consuming excessive resources.

#### Identifying Long-Running Queries

The following query helps find active sessions with queries running for more than 5 minutes:

```sql
SELECT
  pid,
  usename,
  datname,
  query,
  state,
  now() - query_start AS duration
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active'
  AND now() - query_start > interval '5 minutes'
ORDER BY duration DESC;
```

This will return session PIDs and the duration of running queries, helping you quickly identify problematic queries.

## Terminating Problematic Sessions

#### Why terminate sessions?

When long-running queries hold onto sessions, it can cause delays and resource contention for other users or applications connecting to the same database.  
In such cases, it's often necessary to forcefully terminate the query or the session. PostgreSQL offers two options:

- `pg_cancel_backend(pid)`: Cancels the currently running query, but keeps the session alive.
- `pg_terminate_backend(pid)`: Forcefully terminates the entire session.

Here, we'll focus on terminating the entire session using `pg_terminate_backend`.

#### Example: Using pg_terminate_backend

Suppose `pg_stat_activity` reveals that session with PID 8121 has been running for too long.  
To terminate it, run the following command:

```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(8121);
```

This command will forcibly terminate the session with the given PID. Any ongoing transaction within that session will be rolled back, and the connection will be closed.

> ⚠️ Caution:
>
> - Permissions: You need to be the owner of the session or have appropriate privileges (e.g., superuser or rds_superuser) to execute this function.
> - Data Consistency: Since ongoing transactions will be rolled back, use with care to ensure application logic and data consistency are not compromised.

## Operational Best Practices

#### Automating Monitoring

While manually checking queries via SQL clients is feasible, setting up automated monitoring and alerting is more effective in production environments.

- Integration with CloudWatch and Lambda:  
  Use an AWS Lambda function to periodically query `pg_stat_activity`. If any queries exceed a certain threshold (e.g., 5 minutes), send an alert via SNS or automatically invoke `pg_terminate_backend` through a script.
- Using Performance Insights:  
  PostgreSQL’s Performance Insights can help you analyze query performance and identify bottlenecks more intuitively.

#### Logging and Post-Mortem Analysis

When terminating sessions, it’s good practice to log the PID, termination timestamp, and query text.  
This information can be used later for root cause analysis, such as identifying missing indexes or unoptimized queries.

## Summary

To effectively manage long-running, session-holding queries in PostgreSQL:

1. Periodically monitor running queries and session states using `pg_stat_activity`.
2. Use `pg_terminate_backend` to forcefully terminate sessions when necessary.

By combining these techniques with automation tools (e.g., Lambda, CloudWatch), you can respond quickly to incidents and maintain long-term performance and stability.  
And always remember to address the root causes—such as query tuning or adding indexes—to prevent recurring issues.
