In today's software development environment and startup world, countless ideas flood in, yet only a fraction of these ideas truly succeed in the market.  
_The Right It_ advocates for “pretotyping” as a means to quickly validate market response with minimal cost and time, thereby clearly distinguishing between ideas that will work and those that won't.

## The XYZ Hypothesis

Most early-stage ideas tend to be vaguely expressed as “some users will ~”. The XYZ Hypothesis transforms this ambiguity into a concrete, measurable statement:

> "At least X% of Y will do Z."

For example:

- Before (Vague Expression):  
  “Some people living in heavily polluted cities will be interested in a reasonably priced device that helps them monitor and avoid air pollution.”

- After (XYZ Hypothesis):  
  “At least 10% of people living in cities where the air quality index is above 100 will purchase a $120 portable pollution detector.”

In other words:

- X (10%): The expected user conversion rate
- Y (People living in cities with an air quality index above 100): The target user group
- Z (Purchase the $120 portable pollution detector): The specific, expected action

By replacing vague terms like “some” with quantitative criteria, you can later determine the hypothesis’s validity with real data.

## Applying It to Your Product

#### MVP

1. Define the Problem and Target:  
   Clearly specify the problem your product or feature is designed to solve and identify the target users.

2. Set Up the XYZ Hypothesis:  
   Formulate the hypothesis by stating specific numbers and conditions.

3. Build a Prototype:  
   Create a minimal viable product (MVP) or a simple landing page to quickly test actual user responses (such as button clicks or conversion rates).

#### Continuous Feedback Loop

Collect data from your tests and monitor whether your initial XYZ hypothesis aligns with reality.  
This established feedback loop enables you to validate the hypothesis rapidly, thereby reducing unnecessary resource expenditure.
