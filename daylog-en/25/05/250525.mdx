## What is the BFF Pattern?

- Definition: When you have multiple types of clients (UI), instead of a single backend (API) serving all of them, the BFF (Backend For Frontend) pattern introduces a dedicated backend for each client type.
- Origin: Originally coined as an internal framework name at SoundCloud, popularized by Sam Newman.
- Traditional vs. BFF
  - _Traditional_: A single generic API incrementally expands to accommodate each client’s requirements.
  - _BFF_: Separate backend services for each client, like “Web BFF” and “Mobile BFF”.

## Why Use BFF?

#### Performance Optimization

- Mobile clients receive lightweight payloads, while web clients get more detailed data.
- Multiple microservice calls are aggregated in the BFF layer to reduce round-trips.

#### Development Efficiency

- Frontend teams gain more control over the backend logic relevant to their UI.
- Full-stack teams can own their BFF, enabling faster feedback and iteration.

#### Maintainability & Scalability

- Client-specific changes are isolated, minimizing side effects.
- Acts as a variant of the API Gateway pattern—common concerns like auth/logging can be handled in a shared layer.

## BFF Implementation Guide (NestJS Example)

#### Project Structure

```
/src
  /bff-web      # Web BFF
    main.ts
    app.module.ts
    controllers/
    services/
  /bff-mobile   # Mobile BFF
    main.ts
    app.module.ts
    controllers/
    services/
  /core-services # Shared microservices
    ...
```

#### Web BFF Example

```typescript
// bff-web/controllers/product.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get, Query } from "@nestjs/common";
import { ProductService } from "../services/product.service";

@Controller("products")
export class ProductController {
  constructor(private readonly productService: ProductService) {}

  @Get()
  async getWebProducts(@Query("page") page: number) {
    // Process data from core services for the web frontend
    const items = await this.productService.fetchAll({ page, size: 20 });
    return items.map((item) => ({
      id: item.id,
      title: item.name,
      description: item.description,
      imageUrl: item.images[0],
      price: item.price.toLocaleString() + "₩",
    }));
  }
}
```

- _Explanation_: Adjusts page size for web; removes unnecessary fields like stock or internal codes.

#### Mobile BFF Example

```typescript
// bff-mobile/controllers/product.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get, Query } from "@nestjs/common";
import { ProductService } from "../services/product.service";

@Controller("products")
export class ProductController {
  constructor(private readonly productService: ProductService) {}

  @Get()
  async getMobileProducts(@Query("limit") limit: number) {
    const items = await this.productService.fetchAll({
      page: 1,
      size: limit || 10,
    });
    // For mobile, image and price are often enough
    return items.map((item) => ({
      id: item.id,
      imageUrl: item.images[0],
      price: item.price,
    }));
  }
}
```

- _Explanation_: Payload is minimized to reduce network costs.

## Real-World Examples

- Catering Kitchen Analogy:

  - A single shared kitchen (backend) prepares the same meal for every event (web, mobile) → overloaded prep & delivery
  - With BFF: Each event gets a tailored kitchen (Web BFF = full course; Mobile BFF = lunchbox) → optimal performance

- Netflix API Gateway:
  - Netflix serves optimized responses through client-specific adapter code.

## Considerations and Trade-offs

- Adoption Cost: Number of services increases, leading to more complex deployment and ops.
- Duplication of Common Logic: Auth, authorization, and logging should be handled in a shared gateway or middleware.
- Service Call Overhead: BFF should not turn into a bottleneck by calling too many microservices.

## Conclusion

The BFF pattern helps meet diverse client requirements and improves development and operational efficiency.  
However, it also introduces architectural complexity due to the increased number of services.  
For shared concerns, a common gateway or library is recommended.  
Using modern frameworks like NestJS, you can quickly build prototypes and serve UI-optimized APIs for each platform.
