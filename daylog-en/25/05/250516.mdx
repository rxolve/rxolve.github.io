“Radical Candor” is a feedback philosophy proposed by Kim Scott, who built her career at Google and Apple. It’s founded on the principle that we must pursue both _genuine personal care (Care Personally)_ and _direct challenge (Challenge Directly)_ at the same time.  
This approach, when applied to a team, resembles a gardener tending to trees—offering the right mix of fertilizer (praise) and pruning (criticism) to help each tree grow strong and healthy.

## What Is Radical Candor?

#### Definition and Origin

- Radical Candor is a management philosophy that encourages candid feedback without losing humanity—being a “Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity.”
- Scott emphasizes that while many managers are taught to avoid feedback, in reality, they have a responsibility to offer the most honest and sincere feedback possible.

#### The Core Compass

At the heart of Radical Candor is a compass made up of two axes: “Care Personally” and “Challenge Directly.”

- Care Personally (Horizontal Axis): Genuinely caring about the growth and well-being of your team members.
- Challenge Directly (Vertical Axis): Offering clear and firm feedback on performance and behavior.

## The Four Quadrants of Feedback

Based on this compass, we can identify four distinct feedback styles—including the ideal Radical Candor and three potential pitfalls managers may fall into.

| Type                     | Description                                     | Analogy                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Radical Candor           | Care deeply and challenge directly              | Provides the water and pruning necessary for healthy growth   |
| Ruinous Empathy          | Too nice to offer criticism                     | Neglects diseased branches, allowing the whole tree to suffer |
| Obnoxious Aggression     | Direct, but without caring                      | Over-prunes and injures the tree                              |
| Manipulative Insincerity | Pretends to care while gossiping or undermining | Secretly poisons the tree while pretending to nurture it      |

## How to Practice Radical Candor

#### Show You Care (Care Personally)

- Keep notes during 1:1s and remember details like birthdays and hobbies.
- Example: “How was that FC Tokyo match last weekend? If you’re up for it, maybe we can catch one next week together.”

#### Challenge Directly

- Give concrete, action-oriented feedback.
- Example: “The error handling was missing from the deployment script. What do you think about wrapping it in a `try-catch` next time?”

#### Be Immediate

- Feedback is most effective when given in real time. Criticism that arrives too late can feel toxic or unfair.

#### Build a Feedback Loop

- Regularly review the team’s feedback culture during retrospectives or stand-ups.
- After reading the book, try implementing one principle per month as a "team challenge."

## Closing Thoughts

Radical Candor is more than just a technique—it’s a key to transforming team culture.  
By tending to your team like a careful gardener, observing closely, and providing just the right mix of care and challenge, you can cultivate a thriving garden where everyone grows together.
