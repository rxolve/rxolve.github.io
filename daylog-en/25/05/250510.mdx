By default, AWS S3 objects are private and only accessible by the owner.  
However, by generating a Presigned URL, you can grant anyone with the URL temporary access to a specific object without exposing your server's credentials.  
This URL includes query parameters like a signature (based on AWS Signature Version 4) and an expiration time, after which the URL becomes invalid automatically.

#### Why Use a Presigned URL?

- Easy File Sharing: Send sensitive files securely via email or messenger.
- Direct Client Upload: Offload heavy file uploads from your server and allow efficient client-to-S3 transfers.
- Least Privilege Access: Grant only minimal permissions like `s3:GetObject` or `s3:PutObject` via IAM policy.

#### How It Works

1. The server uses AWS credentials to generate a Presigned URL (with an expiration setting).
2. The client sends an HTTP request (`GET`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, etc.) directly to S3 using the Presigned URL.
3. AWS validates the URL's query parameters (e.g., `X-Amz-Signature`, `X-Amz-Expires`) before fulfilling the request.
4. The user can interact with the S3 object securelyâ€”without needing AWS SDKs or separate HTTP clients.

> ðŸ’¡ Analogy: A Presigned URL is like a door without a lock. As long as the visitor (client) has the key (URL), they can freely go in and out within the valid time frame.

#### Common Use Cases

- File Download Sharing

  - Share files with external systems like social media, email, or chatbots.
  - Strengthen security by setting a short expiration (5 minutes to 1 hour).

- Client-Side Uploads

  - Allow users to upload directly to S3 from React, Vue, or Angular apps without going through your backend.
  - Use `PUT` or `POST` Presigned URLs.

- Metadata Inspection

  - Use `HEAD` requests to fetch object size, content type, and other metadata.
  - Useful for verifying large uploads before they happen.

- Limited API Access
  - Replace short-term API tokens with Presigned URLs for cost and permission control.
  - Combine with CloudFront Signed URLs for CDN distribution.

#### Security Considerations

- Manage Expiration Time: Recommend 5 minutes to 1 hour depending on sensitivity.  
  Too long increases risk of exposure; too short may impact UX.
- Enforce HTTPS: Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks when URLs are transmitted.
- Minimal IAM Permissions: Only allow the required actions (`s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, etc.).
- Use CloudTrail: Monitor when and by whom each Presigned URL was used.
- POST Presigned + CORS: Ideal for large Multipart Upload scenarios.
