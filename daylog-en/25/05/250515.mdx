At AWS Summit Seoul 2025, a notable number of sessions were dedicated to AWS Bedrock, closely tied to the growing momentum of Generative AI.  
From Daangn Pay’s Text-to-SQL implementation and CJ CheilJedang’s enterprise AI platform, to breakthroughs in image search, enhanced RAG accuracy, and Bedrock-powered SaaS development — the event was rich with real-world use cases and architectural best practices.  
This post summarizes the key Bedrock sessions at the Summit, highlighting their technical content, usage patterns, and practical insights.

## Key Bedrock Sessions from the Summit

### Daangn Pay’s Data Transformation with Text-to-SQL

In the session titled “Driving Data Innovation with Text-to-SQL on Amazon Bedrock: Daangn Pay’s Fintech Strategy”, the team demonstrated how natural language queries were converted into SQL, lowering the barrier to financial data analysis.  
The speaker explained prompt engineering techniques for reliably generating complex SQL, and how they built a real-time query architecture using AWS Lambda and Aurora Serverless.

- Imagine a user saying, _“Show me last month’s expenses.”_ Bedrock acts like a chef reading a recipe (SQL), while Lambda is the kitchen preparing and serving the dish to the table — all behind the scenes.

### CJ CheilJedang’s Integrated AI Platform

In “CJ CheilJedang’s AI Transformation: Building an Enterprise-Optimized AI Platform with Amazon Bedrock”, the session detailed how internal data and workflows were unified under a standardized AI platform using Bedrock.

- By combining fine-tuned models and a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline, they automated food safety document summarization and real-time quality predictions.
- When a food inspection report is input, the platform generates business-friendly summaries like _“Watch out for the following issues with this product.”_

### Revolutionizing Image Search Services

In the session titled “Reimagining Image Search with Amazon Bedrock”, the speaker showed how Bedrock’s multimodal capabilities were used to generate image embeddings for similar image search and recommendation systems.

- Flow: Image → Bedrock API → Embedding via CLIP-like model → Indexed in OpenSearch/Kendra → User query → Similarity search → Results.
- It's like telling a virtual museum guide, _“Show me artworks similar to this flower,”_ and Bedrock translates each image into a melody, finding others with harmonizing tunes.

### RAG Accuracy Optimization: Mastering Knowledge Bases

The session “Secrets to Boosting RAG Accuracy: Mastering Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases” was a live demo that walked through the full pipeline — from data source connections to query-response engine tuning using AWS’s managed Knowledge Base.

- Steps: Data ingestion (Glue/Databases), embedding generation (SageMaker + Bedrock), retrieval + result composition (best practice filters).
- It also introduced the use of _purpose-driven prompt templates_ that assign weights to search results to boost response consistency and accuracy.

### Building SaaS Services with Bedrock

The session “Building Generative AI SaaS Services with Amazon Bedrock” shared how to efficiently provision tenant-specific instances in a multi-tenant environment, optimize costs, and ensure security compliance.

- Architecture: API Gateway + Lambda microservices → Bedrock calls → Result caching via DynamoDB/Timestream → Integration with per-tenant billing system.
- Analogy: Like a shared office’s meeting room booking system — when a customer sends a request, a free room (LLM instance) is assigned, cleaned up after use, and prepared for the next guest.

## Insights from the Summit

- Model diversity matters: Bedrock’s multi-vendor FM support is like a toolbox — choose the best tool (model) for each task.
- Serverless is the new norm: Combining Lambda with Bedrock enables fast prototyping and effortless scaling with minimal infrastructure overhead.
- Responsible AI is essential: Across sessions, speakers emphasized secure architectures using IAM, KMS, VPC endpoints, and ethical AI practices through prompt/output filtering.

## Best Practices

1. Prompt design is your blueprint: For complex scenarios like SQL conversion, image embeddings, and RAG pipelines, modularize prompt templates to increase reusability and clarity.
2. Logging and monitoring are essential: Attach CloudWatch metrics to every Bedrock call — monitor latency, error rates, and cost patterns in real time to detect anomalies.
3. Start small, scale smart: Validate fine-tuning or RAG on a small slice of internal data first, then expand to production datasets in a gradual rollout strategy.
