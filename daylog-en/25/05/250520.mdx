Architecture Decision Records (ADR) are a technique for documenting important decisions made during the system design process, along with their background, considerations, and outcomes, all in a consistent format.  
They help team members quickly understand the rationale and trade-offs behind technical choices, and ensure that architectural knowledge is passed down intact—even as the project grows or team members change.  
An ADR is not just a memo; it’s a design journal that clearly shows: what problem (context) existed → what alternatives were considered → what decision was made → and what the consequences were.

## What is an ADR?

#### Definition

- An ADR is a small markdown document for recording Architecturally Significant Decisions.
- Each document includes five sections: Title, Status, Context, Decision, and Consequences.
- It is managed as a plain text file (.md), usually stored in a directory like `doc/adr/` in sequential order.

#### Analogy

- Travel journal: Just like a single photo can capture the mood of a day during a trip, a single ADR captures the essence of the architectural thought process at a given moment.
- Medical chart: Like a chart logs a patient’s diagnosis, treatment, and progress, an ADR structures the reasoning, alternatives, and outcomes of a system decision.

## Why Use ADRs?

#### Knowledge Transfer and Collaboration

- The original architect may remember why a certain framework or S3 storage option was chosen, but that knowledge fades with time.
- Later developers might wonder or guess by reading the code, but with an ADR, they can instantly understand: “On YYYY-MM-DD, this option was chosen due to cost and maintainability concerns.”

#### Transparency in Decision-Making

- ADRs are more polished than meeting notes—they strip away the noise and leave the core.
- Just like with code, ADRs should go through pull requests (PRs) to allow team-wide review and consensus.

## ADR Format and Example

#### Basic Template

```markdown
# ADR 001: [Title]

## Status

(Examples: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated)

## Context

- Background and requirements that led to this decision
- Constraints and conditions considered

## Decision

- Final chosen option
- Details like key parameters, versions, configurations

## Consequences

- Positive and negative impacts of the decision
- Any follow-up tasks or trade-offs
```

#### Monorepo vs. Multi-repo

```markdown
# ADR 002: Monorepo vs. Multi-repo

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- 5 team members, 3 services
- Need for code sharing and reusable libraries

## Decision

- Chose Monorepo approach
  - Using TurboRepo
  - Shared CI pipelines

## Consequences

- Easier code reuse
- Simplified branch management per PR
- Initially longer build times (→ caching needed)
```

## Practical Tips

1. Write small, write often  
   Even small decisions should be recorded as ADRs if they bring meaningful architectural change.
2. Use sequential numbers  
   Naming files like `0001.md`, `0002.md` makes it easier to search and refer.
3. Manage the status  
   Keep track of state changes like Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated for easy future reviews.
4. Link ADRs to PRs  
   If a code change requires a new ADR, always reference the ADR number in the commit message or PR description.
5. Review regularly  
   During sprint retros or quarterly meetings, review the ADR log and mark outdated ones as Deprecated.

## Final Thoughts

ADR might feel like a hassle at first, but for long-term projects or distributed teams, it becomes an essential "architecture backup."  
Like a travel diary you can revisit—“Why did we make that decision back then?”—an ADR is a powerful tool you’ll be glad to have. Start today by documenting even just one small decision.
