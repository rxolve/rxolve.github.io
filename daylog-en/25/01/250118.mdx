Content-Disposition is an HTTP header used by the server to specify how the client should handle a file.

#### attachment

Using attachment, you can provide a file response that is downloadable.

```http
Content-Disposition: attachment
```

#### filename

The filename attribute allows you to specify the name of the file to be saved by the user.

```http
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="filename.jpg"
```

#### filename\*

By using the filename\* attribute, you can specify file names encoded in UTF-8.

This is particularly useful when specifying file names in Korean.

```http
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*=UTF-8''%ED%85%8C%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8.pdf

```
