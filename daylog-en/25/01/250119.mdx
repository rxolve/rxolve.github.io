Browsers mainly use two standards for URL encoding. RFC 3986 and HTML Form Encoding.

#### RFC 3986

- Used with the `encodeURI` function.
- General encoding rules for the entire URL.
- Reserved characters: These have special meanings and are only encoded when necessary.  
  `:`, `/`, `?`, `#`, `[`, `]`, `@`, `!`, `$`, `&`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `;`, `=`

- Unreserved characters: These are left as they are.  
  Alphabets (`a-z`, `A-Z`), numbers (`0-9`), `-`, `.`, `_`, `~`

- Other characters: Characters that are not allowed in URLs must be percent-encoded.
  - Example: A space (` `) becomes `%20`.
  - Special characters (e.g., `@`) become `%40`.

#### HTML Form Encoding

- Used with the `encodeURIComponent` function.
- This is the encoding method used when sending form data.
- Similar to RFC 3986 but with one key difference.
  - Spaces (` `) are encoded as `+` instead of `%20`.
