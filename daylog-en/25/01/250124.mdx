### Upstream Server Issues

- If the upstream server that Nginx is routing requests to encounters a Single Point of Failure (SPOF), this can cause problems.
- Examples include the server being down or not responding to requests.

### Keep-Alive Connection Problems Between Nginx and Upstream

- Nginx tries to reuse existing Keep-Alive connections with the upstream server.
- If the connection is no longer valid, requests will fail.
- This often leads to errors like `"Connection reset by peer"`.

### Using Circuit Breaker Pattern

- Nginx cannot directly handle Circuit Breaker logic.
- Instead, use application-level solutions to manage request failures.

Hereâ€™s an example using NestJS with the `nestjs-resilience4j` library:

```ts
import { Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";
import { CircuitBreaker } from "@nestjs/resilience4j";

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  @CircuitBreaker({
    fallback: () => "Fallback: Upstream is currently unavailable",
  })
  async callUpstream() {
    // Logic for calling the upstream server
  }
}
```

- This setup detects failed requests and blocks them temporarily.
- The fallback function provides a backup response when the upstream server is unavailable.
