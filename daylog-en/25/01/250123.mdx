#### USING

The `USING` clause in PostgreSQL is used when changing a column's data type.

It specifies how to convert existing data into the new type.

1. Table Schema at Creation

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  age INTEGER
);
```

2. Changing the Data Type

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
  ALTER COLUMN age
  SET DATA TYPE DOUBLE PRECISION
  USING age::DOUBLE PRECISION;
```

Here, `USING age::DOUBLE PRECISION` tells PostgreSQL to convert the `age` column's values from `INTEGER` to `DOUBLE PRECISION`.

## How It Relates to pg_restore

When using `pg_restore` to restore a database, differences between the schema at backup time and the schema at restore time might require data type conversions.

In such cases, `pg_restore` automatically includes `USING` clauses in the generated DDL statements to ensure the data is converted properly and no data is lost during the process.
