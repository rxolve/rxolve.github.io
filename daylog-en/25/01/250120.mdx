This post explains how to calculate weekly running mileage for marathon preparation using the principle of progressive overload.

## Concept

#### Progressive Overload Principle

Gradually increase your running mileage based on your current weekly mileage.

To stay safe, don't increase your total mileage by more than 10% per week.

#### Target Weekly Mileage for a Full Marathon

- Finish goal (no specific time): 40–60 km/week
- Sub-4-hour goal: 50–80 km/week
- Sub-3:30 goal: 70–100 km/week
- Sub-3-hour goal: 90–120 km/week or more

#### Tapering

Reduce your weekly mileage over the last 3 weeks before the race.

This helps you recover and focus on the event.

## Formula Design

#### Inputs

- daysLeft: Days left until the marathon.
- goalTime: Target finish time for the marathon (e.g., 4 hours → `4.0`).
- currentMileage: Current average weekly mileage (default: 20 km).

#### Steps

1. Total Training Weeks

   ```ts
   weeksLeft = Math.floor(daysLeft / 7);
   ```

   Divide the remaining days by 7 to get the total training weeks.

2. Target Weekly Mileage  
   Define the final weekly mileage based on the goal time.

   - 5+ hours → 50–60 km
   - 4–5 hours → 60–80 km
   - 3:30–4 hours → 80–100 km
   - Under 3 hours → 100+ km

3. Weekly Mileage Increase  
   Gradually increase mileage by applying the 10% rule.

   ```ts
   increasePerWeek =
     (targetMileage - currentMileage) / (weeksLeft - taperWeeks);
   ```

4. Tapering  
   Reduce mileage in the last 3 weeks.
   ```ts
   taperWeeks = 3;
   ```

## Code

```ts
const calculateWeeklyMileage = (
  daysLeft: number,
  goalTime: number,
  currentMileage: number = 20
): number[] => {
  const weeksLeft = Math.floor(daysLeft / 7);

  const targetMileage: number = (() => {
    if (goalTime >= 5.0) return 50; // 5+ hours
    if (goalTime >= 4.0) return 70; // 4–5 hours
    if (goalTime >= 3.5) return 90; // 3:30–4 hours
    return 110; // Under 3 hours
  })();

  const taperWeeks = 3;
  const trainingWeeks = weeksLeft - taperWeeks;

  if (trainingWeeks <= 0) {
    throw new Error("Not enough time! You need at least 4 weeks.");
  }

  const increasePerWeek = (targetMileage - currentMileage) / trainingWeeks;
  const weeklyMileage: number[] = [];

  for (let week = 1; week <= weeksLeft; week++) {
    if (week <= trainingWeeks) {
      weeklyMileage.push(
        parseFloat((currentMileage + increasePerWeek * (week - 1)).toFixed(1))
      );
    } else {
      const taperFactor =
        week === weeksLeft - 2 ? 0.7 : week === weeksLeft - 1 ? 0.5 : 0.3;
      weeklyMileage.push(parseFloat((targetMileage * taperFactor).toFixed(1)));
    }
  }

  return weeklyMileage;
};
```

## Example

If there are 286 days left until the 2025 JTBC Marathon, and you aim to finish in 3 hours 30 minutes, your weekly mileage will be

```ts
calculateWeeklyMileage(286, 3.5);

// [
//   20, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37,
//   38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 55,
//   57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 74,
//   76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 63, 45, 27
// ]
```

Looks like a busy training season ahead!
