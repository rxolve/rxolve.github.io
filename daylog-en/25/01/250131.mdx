When removing a specific item from an array, `filter` is generally more useful than `splice`.

#### Problems with `splice`

```typescript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
arr.splice(1, 1); // Removes the item at index 1 (value 2)
console.log(arr); // [1, 3, 4]
```

- `splice` modifies the original array, which can cause unexpected side effects.
- Since it removes items by index, you first need to find the correct index.
- If used inside a loop, index shifts can lead to unintended behavior.

#### Advantages of `filter`

```typescript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const newArr = arr.filter((item) => item !== 2);
console.log(newArr); // [1, 3, 4]
```

- `filter` does not change the original array but returns a new one (ensuring immutability).
- It keeps only the items that meet a condition, making the code easier to read.
- Instead of relying on index positions, it filters based on values, making it more flexible.
