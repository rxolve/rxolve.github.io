## What is AWS CDK?

- **AWS CDK** (Cloud Development Kit) is a tool that allows you to define your AWS infrastructure declaratively (IaC: Infrastructure as Code) using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Java, or C#. With a single `cdk deploy` command, you can deploy your infrastructure.
- **Advantages**
  - Define infrastructure using familiar programming languages → IDE autocompletion, code reuse
  - Abstracted construct libraries → Create resources like VPCs, Lambdas, and S3 buckets with just a few lines of code
  - Stack dependency management and safe drift detection

---

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS Account & IAM User**

   - Grant `AdministratorAccess` or minimum permissions required by CDK

2. **Install Node.js**

   - CDK CLI is Node.js-based; Node.js v16 or later is recommended

3. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**

   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux (Homebrew)
   brew install awscli
   # Windows (MSI)
   https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

   # Set credentials
   aws configure
   # Enter AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region (e.g. us-east-1), and output format (e.g. json)
   ```

---

## Installing and Initializing the CDK CLI

```bash
# Install globally via npm
npm install -g aws-cdk@2

# Verify installation
cdk --version    # e.g. 2.78.0 (build xxxx)
```

---

## Creating Your First CDK Project

```bash
mkdir my-cdk-app
cd my-cdk-app

# Initialize a TypeScript CDK project
cdk init app --language typescript
```

> Generated project structure:
>
> ```
> my-cdk-app/
> ├── bin/
> │   └── my-cdk-app.ts        // Entry point
> ├── lib/
> │   └── my-cdk-app-stack.ts  // Stack definition
> ├── cdk.json
> ├── package.json
> └── tsconfig.json
> ```

---

## Defining a Stack

Add the following code to `lib/my-cdk-app-stack.ts`:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';

export class MyCdkAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new s3.Bucket(this, 'MySampleBucket', {
      versioned: true,
      removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY, // For development: delete bucket on stack removal
      autoDeleteObjects: true,
    });
  }
}
```

---

## Deploying

1. **Bootstrap (initialize AWS environment)**
   If deploying to an AWS account/region for the first time, run:

   ```bash
   cdk bootstrap aws://{ACCOUNT_ID}/{REGION}
   ```

2. **Check stack changes**

   ```bash
   cdk diff
   ```

3. **Deploy the stack**

   ```bash
   cdk deploy
   ```

4. **Destroy the stack**

   ```bash
   cdk destroy
   ```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Construct Level Hierarchy**

   - **L1 Constructs**: Direct 1:1 mapping with AWS CloudFormation resources (e.g., `CfnBucket`)
   - **L2 Constructs**: Higher-level abstraction with validation and connections (e.g., `Bucket`)
   - **L3 Constructs (Patterns)**: Pre-built combinations of multiple resources (e.g., `ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService`)

2. **Use Multiple Stacks & Stages**

   - Separate stacks per environment (dev, staging, prod)
   - e.g., `cdk deploy MyApp-dev`

3. **Manage Context and Environment Variables**

   - Use `cdk.json` or the `--context` flag

4. **Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines**

   - Use tools like AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions
   - Leverage the `aws-cdk-lib/pipelines` module

5. **Security**

   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Use `cdk diff --security-only` to check only security-related changes (integrates with AWS Security Hub)

6. **Testing**

   - Write unit tests using Jest or pytest
   - Perform snapshot tests to validate stack structure
