A2A (Agent-to-Agent) is an open communication protocol designed to enable AI agents—built on different platforms, by different vendors, and in different frameworks—to collaborate and communicate using a standardized interface.
In other words, agents using A2A can exchange information and divide complex tasks as if they speak a shared “common language,” allowing them to participate in the same workflow naturally and efficiently.
This enables agents developed by different companies or teams to interoperate seamlessly, facilitating the construction of more flexible and scalable agent-based systems.

## Background and Necessity

Traditionally, AI agents have been tied to specific platforms or frameworks, operating in isolation or within limited scopes.
However, in real-world enterprise environments, it's common for multiple AI agents to coexist and handle complex business logic together.
For instance, a sales agent might handle lead generation, while an engineering agent produces post-analysis reports, and a financial forecasting agent projects future revenue. These agents often need to work together.
If each agent only operates via its proprietary protocol, interoperability drops and custom orchestration code must be written—drastically increasing system complexity.

A2A was introduced to solve this issue. Spearheaded by Google in collaboration with partners like Anthropic, LangChain, Cohere, Salesforce, MongoDB, SAP, and more, A2A provides a clear standard for agent-to-agent communication.
With A2A, enterprises can implement agent collaboration without drastically altering their existing IT stack.

## Design Principles

The A2A protocol follows five core design principles:

1. Accept Agent Capabilities
   Agents can collaborate in an unstructured, natural way—even without sharing memory, tools, or context. Each agent operates independently while exchanging only necessary information to support multi-agent scenarios.

2. Build on Existing Standards
   Based on widely adopted technologies like HTTP, Server-Sent Events (SSE), and JSON-RPC 2.0, A2A ensures smooth integration with existing enterprise systems.

3. Enterprise-Grade Security by Default
   From day one, A2A has supported OpenAPI-level authentication and authorization, preventing unauthorized access and data leaks during agent communication.

4. Support for Long-Running Tasks
   From quick responses to multi-day research tasks requiring human input, A2A supports a broad range of operations. Real-time feedback, notifications, and status updates help agents carry out multi-step workflows reliably.

5. Modality-Agnostic
   A2A is not limited to text-based communication—it supports multimedia modalities like audio and video streaming, allowing agents to exchange rich data including voice, visuals, and images.

## Communication Mechanism

The A2A protocol uses the following technologies for communication:

- HTTP(S)-based communication: Message exchanges occur over HTTPS. APIs are designed in a REST-like style, allowing agents to invoke each other’s endpoints.
- JSON-RPC 2.0: A lightweight remote procedure call protocol where requests and responses are exchanged in JSON format. This standard structure enables agents to invoke each other’s methods and receive responses.
- Server-Sent Events (SSE): Used to stream updates in real time, especially for long-running tasks. Clients (or other agents) can keep an open HTTP connection to receive events as they occur.

These components enable agents to share their state in real time and handle complex collaborations with ease.

## Difference Between A2A and MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP, proposed by Anthropic, is a protocol focused on enabling a single AI model to interact with external tools or systems. In contrast, A2A is a decentralized protocol designed for multi-agent collaboration.

- MCP (Model Context Protocol): Centralized in nature, optimized for scenarios where an agent calls external tools (e.g., search, databases, calculators). It supports tool-usage by a single agent.
- A2A (Agent-to-Agent): Decentralized, enabling agents built by different vendors or on different frameworks to work together. For example, a sales agent can request insights from a strategy agent, which processes internal data and returns results back.

In real-world use, A2A and MCP can complement each other: A2A handles inter-agent collaboration, while MCP supports tool interactions.

## Key Features & Ecosystem

1. Universal Interoperability

   - Agents can communicate using common message formats and APIs regardless of their hosting environment—cloud, on-premise, or vendor-specific.
   - Agents built by one organization can collaborate with those from another without custom code.

2. Enterprise-Grade Security

   - Built-in security mechanisms match OpenAPI authentication/authorization standards.
   - Agents verify each other’s identity and only accept authorized messages—ensuring secure communications.

3. Modular Scalability

   - A2A supports everything from quick tasks to long-term research involving multiple agents.
   - Features like real-time feedback and status streaming via SSE simplify system-wide monitoring.

4. Broad Industry Participation

   - Over 50 industry partners, including Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, LangChain, Cohere, Salesforce, MongoDB, and SAP, are involved.
   - Open-source repository: [https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A) provides specifications, sample code, SDKs, and documentation for easy onboarding.

## Example Use Cases

- Travel Planning Agent Workflow
  A sample workflow may involve two local agents collaborating to plan a trip. The first agent gathers tourist spots based on user requests, and the second handles currency conversion and booking. Once done, results are sent back to the first agent.
  Developers only need to implement individual agent logic—A2A handles the coordination.

- Enterprise Multi-Agent Automation System
  Platforms like Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio support A2A to enable automated pipelines involving internal and external agents.
  For instance: Finance Reporting Agent → Forecasting Agent → Audit Report Generator → Delivery Agent, forming a sequential workflow.

## Future Outlook

A2A acts as a common language for AI agents, ensuring interoperability even when they are independently developed and operated.
As more key players like Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, and LangChain join the ecosystem, agent-based automation becomes increasingly feasible without overhauling existing systems.
In the future, agents will combine their specialized capabilities to complete more sophisticated workflows—A2A will be the core infrastructure enabling this evolution.
Coupled with protocols like MCP, agents will not only interoperate internally but also integrate seamlessly with external tools and systems, delivering highly capable and adaptive AI services.
