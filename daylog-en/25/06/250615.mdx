## What is Warp Terminal?

Warp is a next-generation terminal emulator built in Rust, available on macOS, Linux, and Windows.  
Unlike traditional shells, Warp enhances productivity with block-based command execution, an IDE-style input editor, and built-in AI assistance.

## Key Features

* Modern UX & IDE-style Input Editor
  * Commands are grouped into blocks, making scrolling, highlighting, copying, and pasting easy.
  * Like a code editor, it supports cursor movement, text selection, and editing (move, copy, cut, etc.).

* AI Tools
  * Offers natural language command suggestions (Next Command) and code generation.
  * In Agent Mode, you can offload tasks like debugging, building, and testing to the AI.
  * AI requests can be used freely within a monthly quota.

* Warp Drive (Notebook & Workflow Sharing)
  * Create interactive notebooks and workflows to collaborate with team members.
  * Supports environment variable management and script templating to build standardized development environments.

* Live Session Sharing
  * Share your terminal session with up to 5 teammates in real-time for collaborative debugging or pair programming.

* Offline-Compatible Core Terminal Features
  * Fully supports traditional terminal capabilities such as executing `ssh`, `git`, color output, true color, and tab completion—even when offline.
