## What is an SSH Key?

* **SSH (Secure Shell)**: A protocol that provides encrypted communication with remote servers.
* **SSH Key**: A pair consisting of a **public key** and a **private key**.

  * **Private Key**: Safely stored on your local machine.
  * **Public Key**: Registered on remote services like GitHub.
* With key-based authentication, you can securely connect without entering a password.

## Generating an SSH Key

1. Open a terminal (or Git Bash) and navigate to your home directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/.ssh
````

If the `~/.ssh` directory doesn’t exist:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
cd ~/.ssh
```

2. Generate a new SSH key pair:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   * `-t ed25519`: Uses the secure and fast Ed25519 algorithm.
   * `-C`: Adds a comment (usually your email address) to the key.

3. Follow the prompts:

   ```
   Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_ed25519):
   → [Press Enter] (recommended default path)

   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
   → [Enter a passphrase if desired, or just press Enter]

   Enter same passphrase again:
   → [Repeat the passphrase]
   ```

4. Confirm the key files were created:

   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   # You should see id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub
   ```

## Adding Your Key to the SSH Agent

1. Start the SSH agent:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   Agent pid 59566
   ```

2. Add your private key to the agent:

   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

   * If you set a passphrase, you’ll be prompted to enter it here.

## Registering Your Public Key with GitHub

1. Copy the contents of your public key:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

   Copy the entire output string.

2. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com) and:

   * Click your profile picture in the top-right corner → **Settings**
   * In the left sidebar, go to **SSH and GPG keys**
   * Click the **New SSH key** button

3. Add your key:

   * **Title**: A description (e.g., "work-laptop", "home-pc")
   * **Key**: Paste the copied contents of `id_ed25519.pub`
   * Click **Add SSH key**

## Verifying the Setup

1. Test your connection to GitHub:

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

2. You should see a message like:

   ```
   Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
   ```

   * If you see a warning like:

     ```
     Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
     ```

     just type `yes`.

## (Optional) Managing with an SSH Config File

If you're using multiple keys or non-default filenames, you can configure them using `~/.ssh/config`:

```text
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  AddKeysToAgent yes
```

## Summary

1. Generate a key with `ssh-keygen`
2. Add your private key to the agent with `ssh-add`
3. Register your public key on GitHub
4. Test the connection with `ssh -T git@github.com`
