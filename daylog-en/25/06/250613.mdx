When delivering audio content through web services, ensuring continuous playback even when users switch tabs or apps is a key element of good user experience.  
This is especially critical in mobile environments where browser policies frequently change, and support can vary significantly across in-app browsers (WebViews). Proper implementation and thorough testing are essential.

## Why Background Playback Matters

- Music & Podcast Services: Playback should continue even when users switch to another app.
- News Narration & Audiobooks: Users should be able to read or listen with the screen off.
- ASMR & Meditation Apps: Audio-only experiences should work without requiring the screen.

To avoid breaking user immersion, seamless playback in the background is a must.

## Key Implementation Principles

- Start playback via user gesture: Mobile browsers block autoplay of sound, so `audio.play()` must be triggered by explicit gestures like button clicks.
- Use the Media Session API: This enhances UX by allowing playback control via the lock screen or notification center.
- Use the Page Visibility API: Detect when the page goes into the background to run additional logic (e.g., analytics, playback state management).

```html
<button id="playBtn">Play/Pause</button>
<audio id="audioPlayer" src="sample.mp3" preload="auto"></audio>
<script>
  const audio = document.getElementById('audioPlayer');
  const btn = document.getElementById('playBtn');
  btn.addEventListener('click', async () => {
    try {
      if (audio.paused) {
        await audio.play();
        btn.textContent = 'Pause';
      } else {
        audio.pause();
        btn.textContent = 'Play';
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.warn('Playback failed:', e);
    }
  });

  if ('mediaSession' in navigator) {
    navigator.mediaSession.metadata = new MediaMetadata({
      title: 'Sample Track',
      artist: 'Artist',
      album: 'Album',
    });
    navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('play', () => audio.play());
    navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('pause', () => audio.pause());
  }
</script>
```

## Browser Support Overview

| Browser                | Background Playback Support | Notes                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| iOS Safari (14+)       | ✅                          | Works even in regular tabs                |
| iOS WKWebView (in-app) | ✅                          | Supported in recent versions              |
| Android Chrome/WebView | ✅                          | Works regardless of PWA installation      |
| KakaoTalk Browser      | ✅                          | Supported on both Android and iOS WebView |

> Note: On older versions like iOS 13 or earlier, background playback may be interrupted in Safari or WKWebView. Clearly define and test your target OS/browser versions.

## PWA Manifest Settings (Optional)

Adding your site as a PWA to the home screen can enable more stable background playback on iOS, especially when running in `standalone` mode.

```json
{
  "name": "Background Audio Demo",
  "short_name": "AudioDemo",
  "start_url": "/background_playback.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "icons": [{ "src": "icon-192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" }]
}
```

## Additional Considerations

- Audio focus management: On Android, implement logic to pause/resume when another app requests audio focus.
- UX guidance: Clearly communicate to users that playback will continue in the background (e.g., “Music will keep playing even when you switch apps”).
- Version testing: Always test on real devices across your target OS and browser versions for reliable playback.
