## Kubelet

The Kubelet is an agent that runs on each node (Worker Node) and continuously ensures that Pods and the containers within them are running properly in a Kubernetes cluster.  
In other words, it serves as a “watchdog” that reconciles the actual state of the cluster with the desired state.

## Main Roles and Functions

- Pod Scheduling and Execution Management
  - It starts containers based on the Pod definitions received from the control plane (API Server) and periodically checks their running status.
- Health Checks and Status Reporting
  - It monitors the status of each Pod (e.g., whether it is running, has crashed, or needs a restart) and periodically reports this information to the API Server.
- Resource Management and Monitoring
  - It monitors resource usage (CPU, memory, network, etc.) on the node to maintain the overall health of the cluster.
  - It collects performance metrics of containers through integration with cAdvisor.
- Volume Mounting and Network Configuration
  - It creates and mounts volumes as defined in Pods, and handles network configuration to ensure smooth communication either within the same node or across different nodes.

## Interaction with Container Runtimes

The Kubelet does not directly manage containers; instead, it interacts with container runtimes—such as Docker, containerd, and CRI-O—via the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).

- CRI Interface
  - Through this interface, the Kubelet passes commands like starting, stopping, and checking the status of containers to the container runtime.
  - Unlike the past reliance on Docker, modern Kubernetes versions recommend direct integration with runtimes that adhere to the CRI.

## Kubelet Configuration and Communication

- Configuration Files and Flags
  - The Kubelet primarily uses the `kubeconfig` file to manage communication settings with the API Server, including authentication details and TLS certificates.
- Periodic Communication with the API Server
  - It periodically sends the status of the node and its Pods to the API Server so that the central control plane can monitor states in a timely manner and reassign Pods if necessary.
- Built-in API Server Functionality
  - Some Kubelet instances offer a simple built-in API server function that can be used locally for querying status information or for debugging purposes.

## Summary

As a core component that ensures the stability and scalability of a Kubernetes cluster, the Kubelet goes beyond being just an agent. It plays a crucial role in managing the lifecycle of containers on each node and in maintaining the overall health and resource status of the system.
