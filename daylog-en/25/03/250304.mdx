## kube-scheduler

The kube-scheduler is Kubernetes’ default scheduler that selects the optimal node to run an unscheduled pod within the cluster.  
This component is a core element of the control plane, placing pods appropriately by considering the overall state of the cluster as well as node resources, policies, and constraints.

## The Role and Importance of kube-scheduler

- Pod Monitoring: The kube-scheduler continuously monitors for newly created pods or pods that have not yet been assigned a node by the API server.
- Node Selection: It filters the set of feasible nodes by taking into account various factors such as the pod’s resource requirements (e.g., CPU, memory), hardware/software constraints, affinity/anti-affinity rules, and data locality.
- Scoring and Ranking: For the nodes that pass the filtering phase, the scheduler applies a priority function to assign scores and selects the node with the highest score.
- Binding: The scheduler reports (binds) the chosen node to the API server, ensuring that the pod is scheduled to run on that node.

## Scheduling Process: Filtering and Scoring Phases

The operation of the kube-scheduler is broadly divided into two phases:

1. Filtering Phase:
   - Purpose: To preclude nodes that do not meet the pod’s scheduling requirements (e.g., resource requests, node selectors, taints/tolerations).
   - Example: Nodes that cannot provide the necessary amount of CPU or memory for the pod are eliminated from consideration.
2. Scoring Phase:
   - Purpose: To apply a priority function to the remaining nodes, assigning a score to each so that the most suitable node can be selected.
   - Note: Multiple priority rules may be applied, and if nodes receive equal scores, the selection might be made arbitrarily or based on additional criteria.

These two phases form the core mechanism of Kubernetes scheduling and can be customized through user-defined policies or scheduling plugins.

## Extensibility and Customization

Recently, the kube-scheduler has adopted a Scheduling Framework that enhances its extensibility by allowing various plugins to be integrated:

- Plugin Stages: Custom plugins can be inserted at different stages—such as `QueueSort`, `Filter`, `Score`, `Reserve`, `Permit`, `Bind`, and `PostBind`.
- Multi-Scheduler Configuration: In addition to the default scheduler, users can configure their own schedulers to apply specialized scheduling policies for specific workloads.

This flexibility allows the kube-scheduler to support complex requirements beyond simple filtering and scoring, thereby adding greater versatility to cluster management.

## Summary

The Kubernetes scheduler acts as the decision engine that determines which node a pod should be placed on, playing a crucial role in maximizing resource efficiency and ensuring the stable execution of applications within the cluster.  
It’s important to note that while the kube-scheduler makes the placement decision, it does not execute the pod—the actual pod execution is handled by the node’s kubelet.
