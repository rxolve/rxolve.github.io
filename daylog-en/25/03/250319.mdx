## What is a PersistentVolume (PV)?

- Definition:  
  A PersistentVolume (PV) is a storage resource that is pre-provisioned by a cluster administrator (or dynamically provisioned via a StorageClass).

  - Characteristics:
    - It is an independent storage object that can be used throughout the entire cluster.
    - It abstracts away the details of the underlying storage system (such as NFS, iSCSI, cloud storage, etc.).
    - It has a lifecycle independent of the Pod that uses it.

- Provisioning Methods:
  - Static Provisioning: The administrator pre-creates a PV and registers it in the cluster.
  - Dynamic Provisioning: When a PVC is requested, a PV is automatically created according to the specified StorageClass.

## What is a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)?

- Definition:  
  A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a storage claim that a developer or user creates to request a specific amount of storage with a particular access mode (e.g., RWO, RWX, etc.).

- Role and Characteristics:
  - It specifies the required storage capacity, access mode, and storage class.
  - It binds to an appropriate PV in the cluster, thereby allocating the storage resource.
  - It has a one-to-one mapping with a PV, and once bound, that PV cannot be used by another PVC.

## Lifecycle of PV and PVC

1. Provisioning

   - Static: If a PV pre-created by an administrator is available, it will be matched when the PVC is created.
   - Dynamic: When a PVC is created, Kubernetes refers to the StorageClass and automatically creates a PV.

2. Binding

   - The control loop finds a PV that meets the PVC’s requirements (capacity, access mode, storage class, etc.) and binds them bidirectionally (using the ClaimRef field).
   - Once bound, the PV’s status changes to Bound.

3. Using

   - The bound PVC is referenced as a volume in a Pod and is mounted inside the Pod.
   - The Pod can read from and write to the storage provided by the allocated PV through the PVC.

4. Reclaiming
   - When a PVC is deleted, the PV’s state changes depending on the policy:
     - Retain: The PV is released while preserving its data, and the administrator must manually reallocate it.
     - Delete: Deleting the PVC also deletes the PV and its backend storage.
     - Recycle: (Not recommended anymore) The data is scrubbed and the PV is prepared for reuse.

## YAML Examples

### Static Provisioning Example

#### PV Definition (pv.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

#### PVC Definition (pvc.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: manual
```

Creating the PV and PVC as shown above results in the PV being bound 1:1 with the PVC, making it ready for use.

### Pod Example Using a PVC (pod.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - name: storage
          mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
  volumes:
    - name: storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: my-pvc
```

When the Pod is created, the PV bound through `my-pvc` is mounted inside the Pod at `/usr/share/nginx/html`, allowing the application to read and write data.

## Practical Tips

- Using StorageClass:  
  When using dynamic provisioning, you can automate PV creation through a StorageClass. This reduces administrative overhead and improves cluster efficiency.

- Clarify Resource Requirements:  
  When creating a PVC, clearly define the required storage capacity and access mode so that the correct PV is bound.

- Data Protection:  
  Choose the appropriate Reclaim Policy carefully when deleting PVCs or PVs to prevent data loss. In production, configure either the Retain or Delete policy based on your needs.

- Namespace Consistency:  
  The PVC and the Pod that uses it must reside in the same namespace.
