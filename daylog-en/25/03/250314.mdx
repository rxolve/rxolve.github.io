## What is a Kubernetes DaemonSet?

A DaemonSet is a Kubernetes resource that ensures a copy of a specific Pod is deployed across all nodes in a cluster—or a designated group of nodes.

- Automatic Scaling and Shrinking: When a new node is added to the cluster, a Pod is automatically scheduled on that node. Conversely, when a node is removed, the corresponding Pod is also deleted.
- Key Difference: Unlike ReplicaSets or Deployments that maintain a specified number of replicas, a DaemonSet runs exactly one Pod per node.

## Main Use Cases of a DaemonSet

DaemonSets are primarily used to deploy node-level system components or agents. For example:

- Log Collection: Running log collection agents such as Fluentd or Filebeat on each node.
- Monitoring: Deploying agents like Node Exporter or kube-proxy for node monitoring and network management.
- Security and Policy Management: Consistently deploying security agents or policy enforcement tools across all nodes.

## DaemonSet Configuration and Specification

Like other Kubernetes resources, a DaemonSet is defined using a YAML file. A basic configuration looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: example-daemonset
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
    k8s-app: example-logging
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-logging
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-logging
    spec:
      tolerations:
        # Example toleration for deploying on control-plane nodes
        - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
          operator: Exists
          effect: NoSchedule
      containers:
        - name: example-container
          image: example/log-collector:latest
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "100m"
              memory: "100Mi"
            limits:
              memory: "200Mi"
          volumeMounts:
            - name: varlog
              mountPath: /var/log
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
      volumes:
        - name: varlog
          hostPath:
            path: /var/log
```

In the example above:

- metadata: Specifies the resource name, namespace, and labels.
- spec.selector: Matches the labels defined in the Pod template to determine which Pods are managed by the DaemonSet.
- spec.template: Defines the Pod specification to be deployed. You can use tolerations, nodeSelector, or affinity to target specific nodes.

## How a DaemonSet Works

- Automatic Deployment: The DaemonSet controller automatically deploys a Pod on every new node added to the cluster.
- Node Selection: By using `.spec.template.spec.nodeSelector` or `.spec.template.spec.affinity`, you can restrict deployment to specific nodes (e.g., only nodes labeled `"ssd: true"`).
- Tolerations: To deploy on control-plane nodes or nodes with taints, you must set the appropriate tolerations.

Additionally, because the DaemonSet controller binds Pods directly to nodes rather than through the default scheduler, Pods are not seen in the Pending state—they execute immediately.

## Updating and Managing a DaemonSet

- Rolling Updates: DaemonSets support rolling updates through an update strategy (`updateStrategy`). When an update occurs, existing Pods are sequentially deleted and replaced with new ones.
- Automatic Recreation: Even if a user manually deletes a Pod, the DaemonSet controller immediately recreates it to ensure that a Pod remains on each node.
- Management: Use commands such as `kubectl get daemonset` and `kubectl describe daemonset` to check the status, and `kubectl set image` to update the Pods.

## Comparing DaemonSet with Other Resources

- ReplicaSet/Deployment vs. DaemonSet:
  - ReplicaSet/Deployment: Specify the number of Pods for distributed deployment but do not guarantee one Pod per node.
  - DaemonSet: Designed to ensure that exactly one Pod is deployed on every node (or selected nodes).
- Static Pod vs. DaemonSet:
  - Static Pod: Managed by the kubelet and not integrated with the API server.
  - DaemonSet: Can be centrally managed through the Kubernetes API, offering more control.

## In Conclusion

1. Guarantee: Runs exactly one Pod on every node (or on selected nodes).
2. Automation: Automatically deploys and cleans up Pods as nodes are added or removed.
3. Practical Use Cases: Ideal for log collection, monitoring, network management, and various operational tasks.
