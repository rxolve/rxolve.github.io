## Kubernetes Service

#### What is a Service?

- Definition:  
  A Service is an abstraction that provides a stable network endpoint (virtual IP) to solve the issue of changing IP addresses of dynamically created and deleted Pods within a cluster.
- Necessity:  
  Since Pods receive different IP addresses upon creation, direct access is not feasible. A Service assigns a fixed DNS name and IP to a set of Pods (typically defined using label selectors) so that internal (or external) clients can access them reliably.

#### Key Features of a Service

- Load Balancing:  
  A Service automatically distributes traffic across multiple connected Pods, performing load balancing.
- Service Discovery:  
  Integrated with cluster DNS, allowing Pods to be accessed by their Service name.
- Flexible Exposure Methods:  
  Depending on the Service type, it can be configured as internal-only (ClusterIP), exposed via node ports (NodePort), provisioned with an external cloud load balancer (LoadBalancer), or mapped to an external DNS (ExternalName).

#### Types of Services

- ClusterIP (Default Type):  
  Assigns a virtual IP that is only accessible within the cluster.
- NodePort:  
  Opens a specific port on all worker nodes to receive external traffic and forward it to the ClusterIP.
- LoadBalancer:  
  Automatically provisions an external load balancer in cloud environments to expose the service externally.
- ExternalName:  
  Returns a DNS CNAME record to map to a specific external domain name.

#### How a Service Works

- Label Selector and Endpoints:  
  A Service uses a label selector to define the set of Pods it connects to and manages the IP addresses of these Pods as endpoints.
- Role of kube-proxy:  
  kube-proxy runs on each node and uses iptables (or IPVS) to route requests from the Service's virtual IP and port to the appropriate Pod.

## Kubernetes Ingress

#### What is Ingress?

- Definition:  
  Ingress is an API object that defines how HTTP/HTTPS traffic entering the cluster should be routed to internal Services.
- Key Features:
  - URL, host, and path-based routing
  - SSL/TLS termination (decryption)
  - Domain-based virtual hosting
  - URL rewriting and redirection

#### Ingress Resource and Ingress Controller

- Ingress Resource:  
  It is merely an object that declares "rules" but does not handle traffic itself. For example, the following YAML defines which Service should handle requests for a specific host and path:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: example-ingress
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
  spec:
    ingressClassName: nginx
    rules:
      - host: example.com
        http:
          paths:
            - path: /app
              pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: app-service
                  port:
                    number: 80
  ```

- Ingress Controller:  
  A component that actually implements the rules defined in the Ingress resource.
  Popular implementations include NGINX Ingress Controller and Traefik, which must be installed separately in the cluster.
  The controller monitors Ingress resources and dynamically generates configuration files for a reverse proxy server (e.g., NGINX) to route traffic accordingly.

#### Use Cases of Ingress

- Single Endpoint for External Traffic:  
  Instead of exposing each Service separately via NodePort or LoadBalancer, Ingress can manage them centrally, allowing for cleaner domain and path-based routing of external access.
- SSL/TLS Implementation:  
  Ingress can facilitate SSL certificate management (e.g., Let's Encrypt) to easily enable HTTPS connections.

## Practical Usage and Summary

#### Service + Ingress Pattern

- Internal Communication:  
  Each application maintains stable internal connectivity through a ClusterIP-type Service.
- External Exposure:  
  Ingress acts as a single entry point for incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests and distributes them to internal Services based on routing rules.
- Ease of Management:  
  Service discovery, load balancing, and SSL implementation can be delegated to the Ingress controller, allowing centralized management of complex external access configurations.

#### Example and YAML

A simple example of Services and Ingress follows the YAML configuration above, where each Service defines a set of Pods using label selectors, and the Ingress resource routes external traffic to specific Services based on host and path rules.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes Services and Ingress are essential networking resources that handle internal service discovery and external traffic routing, respectively.

- Service: Provides a stable network endpoint for a set of Pods, allowing for consistent access and different exposure types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, etc.).
- Ingress: Defines HTTP/HTTPS routing rules to distribute traffic among multiple Services from a single entry point, with added features like SSL/TLS termination and domain-based routing.
