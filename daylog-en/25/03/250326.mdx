As the evaluation season approaches, I needed a clear overview of past work.  
Let's explore how to retrieve commit history from a Git repository and filter commits by a specific user.

```bash
git log --all --since="2024-07-01" --pretty=format:"%an|%ad|%s" --date=short | grep "user_id" | nl -w1 -s'|' > user_commits.txt
```

#### `git log --all --since="2024-07-01"`

- `git log`  
  The basic command to display commit history in a Git repository.

- `--all`  
  Retrieves commit history from all local branches. This option is essential if you want to analyze the entire repository rather than a specific branch.

- `--since="2024-07-01"`  
  Filters commits made after July 1, 2024. This helps focus on changes within a specific period.

#### `--pretty=format:"%an|%ad|%s" --date=short`

- `--pretty=format:"%an|%ad|%s"`  
  Defines the output format of the commit log.

  - `%an`: Author name
  - `%ad`: Commit date
  - `%s`: Commit message

  Each piece of information is separated by a pipe (`|`) for better readability.

- `--date=short`  
  Displays dates in a concise format (e.g., `2024-07-01`).

#### Piping (`|`) to Connect Commands

The `git log` command is piped into subsequent commands to process and filter data efficiently.  
This approach is highly useful when chaining commands in a shell to streamline data processing.

#### `grep "user_id"`

- `grep "user_id"`  
  Filters the output to include only lines containing "user_id".  
  This ensures that only commits related to the specified user are selected, whether they appear in the commit message or author name.

#### `nl -w1 -s'|'`

- `nl` (number lines)  
  Adds line numbers to each row of the output.

- `-w1`  
  Sets the minimum width of the line number to one character.

- `-s'|'`  
  Specifies `|` as the separator between the line number and commit information.  
  Example output:

  ```
  1|user1|2024-07-05|Update user profile feature
  2|user123|2024-07-06|Fix user login issue
  ```

#### `> user_commits.txt`

- `>`  
  Redirects the final output to the `user_commits.txt` file.  
  This allows for later analysis or sharing without displaying the results directly in the terminal.

#### Summary

This command sequence works as follows:

1. Retrieves all commits from all branches since July 1, 2024.
2. Outputs author, date, and message, separated by a pipe (`|`).
3. Filters results to include only those containing "user_id".
4. Adds line numbers for better readability.
5. Saves the final output to `user_commits.txt`.

By combining these Git and shell commands, we can efficiently extract and analyze commit data based on specific criteria. ðŸš€
