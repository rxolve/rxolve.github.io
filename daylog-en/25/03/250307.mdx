## kube-proxy

kube-proxy runs on each node (Worker Node) and serves as a core component of Kubernetes networking.  
It implements service abstraction by routing network requests—both from within and outside the cluster—to the appropriate Pod, effectively acting as a "network router."

## Main Roles and Functions

- Routing Network Traffic and Load Balancing
  - kube-proxy monitors network requests within the cluster and routes them to the appropriate Pod (endpoint) to perform load balancing.
- Managing Services and Endpoints
  - It continuously monitors changes to Service and Endpoint objects from the Kubernetes API Server, dynamically updating the network routing rules accordingly.
- Traffic Forwarding Based on iptables/IPVS
  - By default, it uses the operating system's iptables to filter and forward network packets.
  - In large-scale clusters, a more efficient IPVS mode can be selected to achieve faster load balancing and enhanced performance.

## Operating Principles

- Dynamic Rule Updates  
  kube-proxy generates, modifies, and deletes iptables or IPVS rules in real time based on the Service and Endpoint information received from the API Server.  
  This ensures that network traffic is always directed to the appropriate backend Pod in accordance with the current cluster state.
- Support for Multiple Operating Modes
  - _iptables mode:_ Routes requests for a Service IP to the appropriate Pod through basic packet filtering and NAT (Network Address Translation).
  - _IPVS mode:_ Utilizes the Linux kernel's IPVS functionality to perform more sophisticated and efficient load balancing.

## Summary

kube-proxy is a core component that guarantees stable network communication within a Kubernetes cluster.  
By dynamically adjusting network rules based on real-time information from the API Server, it enables smooth connectivity between Services and Pods and effectively distributes network traffic.
