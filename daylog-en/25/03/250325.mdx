#### Concurrency

- Definition:  
  Concurrency is the concept of designing a system where multiple tasks appear to be executed simultaneously.  
  In reality, parts of one task are executed, followed by parts of another task, with fast context switching making them appear concurrent.
- Characteristics:
  - Possible even on a single core: Multiple tasks can run on a single CPU core using time slicing.
  - Structural approach: Focuses on managing multiple tasks efficiently and includes patterns to handle complexity (e.g., event loops, asynchronous programming).
  - Resource sharing issues: When concurrent tasks access shared resources, synchronization problems such as race conditions and deadlocks can arise.

> For example, Node.js asynchronous I/O operates on a concurrency model that handles multiple requests in a single thread.

#### Parallelism

- Definition:  
  Parallelism refers to the execution of multiple tasks physically at the same time.  
  This is achieved by utilizing multiple cores or multiple CPUs.
- Characteristics:
  - True simultaneous execution: When multiple cores are available, each core processes different tasks independently, enabling genuine parallel execution.
  - Performance improvement: Parallel processing maximizes CPU efficiency and reduces overall execution time.
  - Limitations: Not all tasks can be parallelized; tasks with dependencies or I/O-bound operations may benefit more from concurrency.

> For example, data parallel processing and multi-threaded computation-heavy tasks can be executed in parallel on a multi-core system, enhancing performance.

#### Relationship and Differences Between Concurrency and Parallelism

- Concurrency is a design philosophy:  
  It is a logical concept that manages and schedules multiple tasks efficiently.  
  Concurrency can be implemented even in a single-processor environment.
- Parallelism is an execution method:  
  It is a physical concept where multiple tasks execute simultaneously.  
  Parallel execution requires multiple cores or CPUs.
- Inclusion relationship:  
  Parallel processing can be considered a subset of concurrency.  
  In other words, parallelism is a type of concurrency where tasks are truly executed simultaneously.

#### Summary

- Concurrency:  
  A design approach where multiple tasks are logically managed to appear as if they are running simultaneously.  
  It can be implemented even on a single core using time slicing and is particularly effective for I/O-bound tasks.
- Parallelism:  
  A method where multiple tasks are physically executed at the same time, typically using multi-core or multiple CPU environments.  
  It is beneficial for compute-intensive tasks and aims to achieve actual performance gains.
