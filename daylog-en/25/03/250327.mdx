Starting from TypeORM version 0.3.x, the `@EntityRepository()` decorator, which was widely used before, is no longer recommended.  
As a result, defining custom repositories in the traditional way is no longer possible, necessitating a new approach that aligns with NestJS’s dependency injection (DI) and module system.

## Problem: The Limitations of @EntityRepository

- Deprecation Issue:  
  Previously, `@EntityRepository()` allowed easy definition of custom repositories associated with entities.  
  However, since this decorator is no longer supported in the latest TypeORM version, an alternative method must be implemented to achieve the same functionality.

- Integration with NestJS:  
  Since NestJS provides a powerful DI container and module system, custom repositories should be registered and managed as providers within NestJS.

## How the CustomRepository Decorator Pattern Works

The following code represents the basic structure of the `CustomRepository` decorator:

```typescript
import { SetMetadata } from "@nestjs/common";

export const TYPEORM_EX_CUSTOM_REPOSITORY = "TYPEORM_EX_CUSTOM_REPOSITORY";

export function CustomRepository(
  entity: new (...args: any[]) => any
): ClassDecorator {
  return SetMetadata(TYPEORM_EX_CUSTOM_REPOSITORY, entity);
}
```

#### Registering Metadata

- Using `SetMetadata` Function:  
  `SetMetadata` is a utility function provided by NestJS that allows attaching key-value metadata to a class or method.  
  Here, the key `'TYPEORM_EX_CUSTOM_REPOSITORY'` and the value `entity` (passed as an argument to the decorator) are stored as metadata.

- Purpose:  
  This metadata indicates that the decorated class (typically a custom repository class) is linked to a specific entity.  
  It is later used when dynamically registering these repositories in a module.

#### Dynamic Provider Registration

Classes decorated with `CustomRepository` can be discovered using NestJS’s `DiscoveryService` or `Reflector`.  
Using this approach, a custom module (e.g., `TypeOrmCustomModule`) can perform the following tasks for each repository:

- Creating Entity-Based Repositories:  
  The `DataSource.getRepository(entity)` method is called to retrieve the base repository,  
  which is then extended to create a new instance of the custom repository class.
- Registering in the DI Container:  
  The created repository instance is registered as a provider in NestJS, making it available for injection in other services or controllers.

By using this pattern, the functionalities previously provided by `@EntityRepository()` can be replicated in a way that fits NestJS’s architecture.

## Why Is This Pattern Necessary?

#### Adapting to the Latest TypeORM Version

Since `@EntityRepository()` has been removed in TypeORM 0.3.x,  
a new approach is required to define and register custom repositories.

#### Integration with NestJS’s DI and Module System

In NestJS, all registered providers are managed through the DI container.  
The `CustomRepository` pattern offers several advantages:

- Explicit Association:  
  The decorator explicitly indicates which entity a given repository is linked to.

- Dynamic Registration:  
  At the module initialization stage, all custom repositories can be dynamically registered as providers based on their metadata.  
  This reduces repetitive boilerplate code and ensures repositories are managed consistently.

- Flexibility:  
  If additional functionalities (e.g., caching, logging, transaction management) need to be injected into the repository in the future,  
  the metadata can serve as a basis for easy expansion.

#### Improved Maintainability and Readability

- Modularized Code:  
  By leveraging decorators, the configuration for custom repositories can be centrally managed in one place.

- Error Prevention:  
  Explicitly defining each repository’s role and associated entity through metadata helps prevent incorrect dependency injection and initialization errors.

Due to these reasons, the `CustomRepository` pattern has become an essential solution in modern NestJS and TypeORM environments.

## Conclusion

With the deprecation of `@EntityRepository()`, a new method for implementing custom repositories in NestJS is required.  
The `CustomRepository` decorator pattern utilizes metadata to specify the entity associated with each repository, enabling dynamic provider registration.  
This approach aligns well with the latest TypeORM version and NestJS’s DI system, significantly improving code modularity and maintainability.
