## What Are Kubernetes Resources?

Kubernetes resources are the blueprints (or objects) used to configure and manage applications and infrastructure within a cluster.  
They are similar to the relationship between classes and instances in object-oriented programming.  
In other words, a resource is the design (class) used to create objects, and the actual instantiated items are the objects.

## Key Resources and Their Roles

#### Pod

- Description: The smallest execution unit in Kubernetes, which can include one or more containers.
- Characteristics: Pods share the same network namespace and storage, and they typically operate as a single instance of an application.

#### ReplicaSet

- Description: Ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at any given time.
- Characteristics: Automatically creates new Pods if the number falls below the desired count, and deletes excess Pods if there are too many.

#### Deployment

- Description: A higher-level resource that manages ReplicaSets, facilitating easy application deployment and updates (e.g., rolling updates, rollbacks).
- Characteristics: By defining the desired state declaratively, the cluster automatically adjusts the actual state to match.

#### StatefulSet

- Description: Used for applications that require persistent state.
- Characteristics: Provides each Pod with a unique network identifier and storage volume, making it ideal for stateful applications like databases or message queues.

#### DaemonSet

- Description: Ensures that exactly one Pod runs on every (or a specific subset of) node(s) in the cluster.
- Characteristics: Particularly useful for deploying system-level services such as log collection and monitoring agents.

#### Job & CronJob

- Job
  - Description: Executes a one-time batch task and terminates once the task is complete.
- CronJob
  - Description: Manages tasks that need to be executed repeatedly on a defined schedule.

#### Service & Ingress

- Service
  - Description: Provides a stable network endpoint for a set of Pods.
  - Characteristics: Performs load balancing and service discovery.
- Ingress
  - Description: Routes external traffic to the appropriate service.
  - Characteristics: Enables sophisticated traffic control such as domain-based and path-based routing.

#### ConfigMap & Secret

- ConfigMap
  - Description: Manages general configuration information for applications.
- Secret
  - Description: Securely stores sensitive data such as passwords and API keys.
- Characteristics: Both resources can be injected into applications via environment variables or mounted volumes.

#### PersistentVolume (PV) & PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

- PV
  - Description: An abstraction of the actual storage resource provided by the cluster administrator.
- PVC
  - Description: The object through which users (or applications) request storage.
- Characteristics: These resources ensure that a container's data persists even after the cluster is restarted.

## Management and Deployment

Kubernetes resources are primarily managed by declaring them in YAML files.  
For example, when defining a Deployment, you can create a YAML file and apply it to the cluster with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Additionally, you can manage resource status, updates, and deletions using various kubectl commands:

- `kubectl get pods` : Lists the running Pods.
- `kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>` : Provides detailed information about a specific Deployment.
- `kubectl delete svc <service-name>` : Deletes a Service.
