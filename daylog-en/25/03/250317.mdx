In a recent project, we encountered an issue where the coupon and product tables had an N:N relationship, stored in the coupon_product mapping table. Each time a global coupon, applicable to all products, was issued, thousands or even millions of records were inserted into the coupon_product table, significantly increasing the database load.

## Issue: Uncontrolled Growth of Mapping Data

In the existing design, to explicitly store the relationship between coupons and products, a record was created in the coupon_product table for every product each time a coupon was issued.

- Massive Data Increase: For global coupons, creating separate mapping records for every product led to an unnecessary surge in data volume.
- Performance Degradation: Complex JOIN operations and increased I/O load during queries.
- Maintenance Challenges: As data volume grows, managing indexes and optimizing queries becomes increasingly difficult.

## Solution: Introducing a Global Coupon Flag

The core of the solution is to add a flag to the coupon table that distinguishes global coupons. By adding an `is_global` column to the coupon table, we can omit the coupon_product mapping for global coupons and simply check this flag during queries.

#### Key Improvements

1. Modifying the Coupon Table

   - Add an `is_global` column.
   - Set this value to `true` for global coupons, automatically applying them to all products.

2. Minimizing Use of the coupon_product Table

   - Apply global coupons without creating separate records in the mapping table.
   - Manage data in the coupon_product table only for coupons that apply to specific products.

3. Optimizing Query Logic

   - Check the `is_global` flag first when determining coupon applicability to avoid unnecessary JOINs.
   - Utilize the mapping table only when there are coupons that apply to specific products.

## Example of Data Model Design

Below is an example of the improved data model design.

```sql
-- Coupon Table: Adding a column to distinguish global coupons
CREATE TABLE coupon (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  coupon_code VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  discount_rate NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,
  is_global BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,  -- Global coupon flag
  -- Other necessary columns
);

-- Product Table
CREATE TABLE product (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  price NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
  -- Other necessary columns
);

-- Coupon-Product Mapping Table: Used only for non-global coupons
CREATE TABLE coupon_product (
  coupon_id INTEGER REFERENCES coupon(id),
  product_id INTEGER REFERENCES product(id),
  PRIMARY KEY (coupon_id, product_id)
);
```

## Example of Application Logic (Pseudocode)

```typescript
// Example of logic to check coupon applicability
if (coupon.is_global) {
  // Apply to all products if it's a global coupon
  applicableProducts = allProducts;
} else {
  // For coupons that apply to specific products, query the mapping table
  applicableProducts = queryProductsByCoupon(coupon.id);
}
```

By designing in this manner, we can prevent a large number of unnecessary inserts when issuing global coupons, and efficiently handle coupon application logic by simply checking the flag.
