## Declarative vs. Imperative Management

- Imperative Management:

  - Resources are created or deleted immediately using CLI commands like `kubectl run` and `kubectl create`.
  - Useful for quick tests or one-off tasks, but it is challenging to maintain a history of the state.

- Declarative Management:

  - Desired state is described by writing YAML files and applied using the `kubectl apply -f` command.
  - Facilitates version control and history tracking of resources, making it easy to reproduce the same configuration across different environments.

## Application Deployment via Deployment

- Role of Deployment:

  - Declaratively defines the desired state of the application (e.g., number of running Pods, image version).
  - Internally creates and manages ReplicaSets, which in turn create Pods to run the actual application.
  - This structure makes it easy to scale, update, and recover applications through Deployment.

- Key Features and Strategies:

  - Rolling Update:

    - The default update method, creating new version Pods one by one while gradually removing old version Pods.
    - Allows for zero-downtime deployment, enabling updates without service interruption.

  - Recreate:

    - Deletes all existing Pods before creating new version Pods; simple but may cause temporary service interruption.

  - Rollback:

    - If issues arise, you can easily revert to a previous stable version using the `kubectl rollout undo` command.

## Deployment Management Commands

- Check Deployment Status:

  - `kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment_name>`  
    → Check the current deployment progress and whether the update is complete.

- Update Image:

  - `kubectl set image deployment/<deployment_name> <container_name>=<new_image>:<tag>`  
    → Update the deployment by applying a new version of the image.

- History and Rollback:

  - `kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment_name>`  
    → View previous deployment histories.

  - `kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment_name>`  
    → Roll back to a previous version if issues occur.

## Automation and Self-Healing

- Role of Controllers:

  - Deployment and ReplicaSet controllers continuously compare the actual state of the cluster with the desired state.
  - If a Pod fails or terminates unexpectedly, they automatically create new Pods to restore the desired state.

- Scaling:

  - `kubectl scale deployment/<deployment_name> --replicas=<desired_count>`  
    → Dynamically adjust the number of Pods according to the application's load.

## Practical Application Tips

- Managing YAML Files:

  - Using version control systems like Git to manage changes in YAML files allows for stable deployments across multiple environments (development/staging/production).

- Monitoring and Log Checking:

  - Regularly checking the status and logs of Pods and Deployments using commands like `kubectl describe` and `kubectl logs` helps in early detection and response to issues.

- Setting Up Test Environments:

  - Testing deployment strategies (e.g., Rolling Update, Canary) in advance helps in selecting the appropriate update strategy for the actual production environment.
