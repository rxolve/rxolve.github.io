## Deployment

The Deployment automates the creation, updates, scaling, and rollbacks of Pods and ReplicaSets, enabling declarative management of your application's state.

- Declarative Management: Define the desired state in a YAML file, and Kubernetes automatically takes the necessary steps to ensure the actual state matches it.
- Self-healing: Detects Pods that encounter issues and automatically recreates them, ensuring the application's availability.

## Key Features and Strategies

#### Declarative Updates

- YAML-based Management: Define your application's specifications in a YAML file and use the `kubectl apply` command to create or update resources.
- Automated Deployment: Kubernetes automatically creates, deletes, or updates the necessary ReplicaSets and Pods based on the declared state.

#### Rolling Update

- Zero Downtime Deployment: Operate both the current and new version of Pods simultaneously, gradually replacing them in fixed proportions.
- Configurable Options: Adjust the number of Pods that are terminated or created simultaneously during updates using the `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge` options, ensuring a smooth deployment without service interruption.

#### Rollback

- Automatic Recovery: Easily revert to a previously stable version if issues arise after a deployment.
- Version Management: Deployment maintains a history of each rollout, allowing you to roll back to a specific revision when needed.

#### Scaling and Expansion

- Horizontal Scaling: Increase or decrease the number of application replicas by adjusting the `replicas` field.
- Load Balancing: Multiple Pods handle incoming requests concurrently, effectively managing increased traffic.

## Deployment Resource Components

A Deployment YAML file is primarily composed of the following sections:

- apiVersion: Typically set to `apps/v1`.
- kind: Specifies the resource type, in this case, `Deployment`.
- metadata: Defines metadata such as the name, namespace, and labels.
- spec: Describes the actual specification, including:
  - replicas: Sets the desired number of Pod replicas.
  - selector: Specifies the label selector to identify the Pods managed by the Deployment.
  - template: Defines the template for the Pods to be created, including details such as container images, environment variables, and volumes.
  - strategy: Sets the deployment strategy (e.g., RollingUpdate or Recreate).

#### Example YAML File

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app-container
          image: my-app-image:v1.0.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
      maxSurge: 1
```

In this example, the `my-app` application is run with three replicas, and during a rolling update, a maximum of one Pod is updated at a time when deploying a new version.

## Key Commands and Practical Usage

- Creating and Updating a Deployment

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
  ```

  Use a declarative approach to create or update the resource.

- Checking Deployment Status

  ```bash
  kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app-deployment
  ```

  Monitor the progress of the deployment in real-time.

- Rollback

  ```bash
  kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-app-deployment
  ```

  Easily roll back to the previous stable version if issues arise.

- Inspecting Deployment Details

  ```bash
  kubectl describe deployment my-app-deployment
  ```

  View detailed information about the Deployment's status and event logs.
