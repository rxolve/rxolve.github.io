When working with strings in JavaScript, replacement operations are often necessary.
It is particularly important to clearly understand the differences between `replace` and `replaceAll` when using regular expressions to find and replace all occurrences of a specific pattern in a string.

## Basic Behavior of replace and replaceAll

- replace

  - When using a string pattern: Only the first matched occurrence is replaced.
  - When using a regular expression:
    - A regular expression without the `g` flag replaces only the first match.
    - A regular expression with the `g` flag replaces all matches within the string.

- replaceAll
  - As the name suggests, this method replaces all occurrences of a match.
  - It supports both string patterns and regular expressions, but if a regular expression is used, the `g` flag must be included.
    > If a regular expression without the `g` flag is passed, a `TypeError` will occur.

## The Role of the g Flag in Regular Expressions

When the `g` flag is added to a regular expression, both `replace` and `replaceAll` behave identically. For example:

```js
const str = "foo foo foo";
const regex = /foo/g;

console.log(str.replace(regex, "bar")); // "bar bar bar"
console.log(str.replaceAll(regex, "bar")); // "bar bar bar"
```

As seen in the example above, using a regular expression with the `g` flag produces the same result for both methods.

## Why Use replaceAll?

#### Clearer Code Intent

- Readability: `replaceAll` explicitly conveys the intent of replacing all occurrences.
- Error Prevention: When using a string pattern, `replace` only modifies the first match, which might lead to unintended results.

#### Exceptional Cases

- Using a Regular Expression: If `replaceAll` is given a regular expression without the `g` flag, an error occurs.
  ```js
  const re = /foo/; // Missing g flag
  console.log(str.replaceAll(re, "bar")); // TypeError occurs!
  ```

Due to this behavior, `replaceAll` is often preferred in modern projects to reduce errors in code execution.

## Practical Tips

- Browser Compatibility  
  `replaceAll` is supported in modern JavaScript engines but may not work in older browsers. If necessary, consider using a polyfill.

- Explicit Code Intent  
  In code reviews or team collaboration, using `replaceAll` makes it clear that all matches are intended to be replaced.

- Replacing Using Regular Expressions  
  If `replace` is used in existing code, adding the `g` flag to the regular expression can achieve the same effect as `replaceAll`.

  ```js
  const str = "a b c d e";
  const newStr = str.replace(/ /g, "-");
  console.log(newStr); // "a-b-c-d-e"
  ```

## Conclusion

When the `g` flag is included in a regular expression, `replace` and `replaceAll` yield the same result. However, `replaceAll` explicitly conveys the intent of replacing all matches, improving code readability and preventing errors.
By choosing the appropriate method based on the situation, you can enhance code stability and maintainability.
