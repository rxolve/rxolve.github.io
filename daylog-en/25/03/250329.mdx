#### Problem Scenario

If a user's input string unintentionally contains C0 control characters (Unicode U+0000 ~ U+001F) or C1 control characters (U+007F ~ U+009F), databases with strict encoding requirements—such as PostgreSQL—may throw errors when executing queries.

To prevent such issues, it is necessary to preprocess the string and remove any problematic control characters.

#### Solution: Unicode Property Escapes

Starting from ECMAScript 2018, Unicode property escapes allow us to easily find and remove all characters belonging to specific Unicode ranges within a string.

Example of Unicode property escapes:

```typescript
// The regular expression /\p{C}/gu finds all characters in the "Other" category (control characters, etc.) of Unicode.
```

This approach is convenient because it eliminates control characters without requiring explicit character range specifications.

#### Implementation Example

Below is a function that removes control characters, which can be used in a NestJS project.

```typescript
/
 * Removes all control characters from the input string.
 * This function uses Unicode property escapes to find and eliminate
 * all characters in the "Other" category (\p{C}) of Unicode.
 *
 * @param input - The original string
 * @returns The sanitized string with control characters removed
 */
export function sanitizeInput(input: string): string {
  // The 'u' flag enables Unicode mode, and the 'g' flag ensures all matches are processed.
  return input.replace(/\p{C}/gu, "");
}
```

- Regular expression `/\p{C}/gu`
  - `\p{C}` matches all control characters in Unicode's "Other" category.
  - The `g` flag ensures that all occurrences in the string are replaced.
  - The `u` flag enables Unicode mode, allowing accurate matching of Unicode code points.
- `replace` method
  - Replaces all matched control characters with an empty string (`''`).

#### Conclusion

Issues caused by control characters in databases or API communication should be addressed proactively.  
It is best to preprocess user input or external data sources in advance to avoid potential errors.
